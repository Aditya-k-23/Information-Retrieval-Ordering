Query is: Did Kumail agreed to our last proposal
->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Results full text index:
Re: Proposal for 2019 Jan-Jun Dear Kumail,

I had a long discussion with my team and we have agreed to add Community
Mall (when it opens) as well as any expansions to the Dubai Mall (Fountain
View or Zabeel) to the scope at no additional cost for year 2019, while
keeping the PO length to be 1 year (instead of 2 years).

I have kept all the pricing and details in the updated proposal exactly the
same (12 months for $198,000) as the 2016 proposal, but have changed the
service duration to 12 months (previously was 17 months) and have added
Spring Souk at no extra cost. Additional APs and expansions are also now at
no additional cost.

I trust this is satisfactory as it adds more properties while not
increasing the costs. I look forward to working together for a productive
2019.

TDM - FAE Expansion Zones Creation Dear Rick,

As discussed during our last meeting, I have shared zone names for New FAE and we agreed to the workings that how it will reflect in the dashboard.
Please let me know if there is anything pending from my side related to Wi-Fi Zone names for the New FAE. I think Kumail is not updated about our meeting.

As I can see that TDM 40 zones Wi-Fi still doesn't include the New FAE zones. Please confirm by what time we can expect it.
Attached an email copy to add some context.

Re: Important query Dear Kumail,

We can deploy the gtbcorps' hosted splash page at TDM. We can also provide
auto-connect without seeing landing page (remembering the device for up-to
2 years).

Attached image (3_1.jpg and 3_1_1.jpg) show how the TDM page looked in the
past. However, at the time, we discovered it is too many questions and we
want to simplify it.

Since we want to promote Facebook, I instead recommend one of the following
type of look & feel (we will brand it with Dubai Mall look) as in
Recommendation1.jpg and Recommendation2.jpg. We can add a video and/or
carousel of images at the top. We recommend showing Facebook as the top
level button with additional options (email/twitter) being hidden to
promote Facebook.

Regarding costs, Lily previously shared Landing Page + Editor as part of
the marketing proposal. We can however, provide as stand alone as well
(without marketing features) with design customization support via the
editor. This can be done as per pricing on the last page of the attached
proposal ($1,000 monthly).

We look forward to working on this and delivering deeper demographic and
user insights.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gtbcorps-Splash Page-Proposal Good Morning Mr. Juzer and Kumail,

It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday and thank you for your time.

Further to our discussions, please find attached proposal for the Splash
Page options.

Option 1 - Form by Emaar and Social Logins by gtbcorps
Option 2 - Splash Page with Form & Social Logins by gtbcorps (on our
cloud). All the editor feature as demonstrated (progressive profijaime,
personalized splash pages etc.)

I have also included pricing for add-ons like Alipay, WeChat and if
gtbcorps Splash Page (option 2) is to be hosted on-robinson at Emaar.

As discussed, we can also run one month trial of gtbcorps Splash Page in
one of the malls/properties so that the user experience can be tested.

Kindly let us know in case of any queries.

gtbcorps_TDM_Store WiFi Analytics_Proposal Good Morning Kumail,

Re: Proposal for 2019 Jan-Jun Dear Kumail

Pending gtbcorps Invoices: EMAAR Group Dear Kumail,

See the details of the invoices to be paid.


- Invoice 093-15 is for setup of gtbcorps Social WiFi. Please pay this
at the earliest convenience.
- Invoice 094-15, 094-16, 094-17 are monthly recurring fees of $32,916
per month as agreed in our agreement.

Please note:

- *We can not provide the bundle discount if the payment is made for
individual products only*. If you individually select the products, the
pricing will be $40,150 per month.
- We are not including any cost of Navigate product even though we have
done all the work requisite from our end, and are continuing to do more
which was responsibility of another vendor. This is all done in good faith.

Additional costs:

- As per the contract, all changes to the splash pages beyond the
initial launch is to be billed at $100 per hour. As you have noticed, we
have not invoiced that.
- As per the contract, email verification was not included as part of
Social WiFi. As we provide this feature, *we incur a cost* of $1,000 per
month as cost to our mail gateway Mailgun and Kickbox.io services. We are
currently paying this on behalf of EMAAR. As you have noticed, we have not
invoiced that.

Hence we request, the payment of all four attached invoices at the earliest.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: gtbcorps data issues Client response:

/////

Dear Juzer,

The change was requested from Bhuvnesh from Business team (refer: Email
with Subject "Emaar: New KPI's:: Q2 2018"). The change was to display
*engaged *vs *bounced *visitors metrics on the system which was
previously not seen due to the removal of visits to the site that are less
than 30 minutes. Removing this filter, allowed, Engagement metric to be
seen on the dashboard.

I had a brief discussion with Kumail on phone, before making the change on
the 40 zone and Instore dashboard. It was agreed in our discussion that the
average dwell time in the dashboard should still reflect on engaged visits
(visits with a dwell time of greater than 30 minutes) which is still
followed. Post the update, we made the change on Neuman dashboard as well
in order to maintain consistency.

Going forward, I'll seek permission for any changes in a written and formal
way from you.

Let me know if you have any questions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Regarding new issues for mapping Dear Kumail and Thimothy,

I did find the new issues today while testing this in the mall, but it
seems like they are due to integration as I am able to see all of them
working fine in our latest SDK build. I will work with Usman tomorrow on
these and get back with an update.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Changes in my dashboard Dear Juzer,

Thank you for having a second look.

It seems like I may have reported the total registrations instead of
connected. Kumail, did mention the way this is reported (aggregation of
sessions) on the call today. Please see the updated values below.

August September
Connected 1867192 1586843
For detected, I believe, the Instore dashboard was used to create the
report, which could have led to this difference. Instore dashboard
typically reports overall high visits due to the inclusion of fashion
avenue expansion and better coverage. Please see the detected as per
Instore.

Instore August September
Detected 6753729 5663269
I'm assuming, the report may have been generated on the last day of
August-18, leading to calculating a day's short of the total detected for
the month. The below is the total detected until August-30th, which is
inline with the numbers shared by you.

Instore August
Detected 6528547

I hope this helps, please let me know if this is inline as per your
expectation or if you need anything else.

Dear Jesse and Carter,



Thank you for all your support and help. This was a very effective session that will help with the integration of the maps within the app.



@Kumail - We have a question that needs answering, I have highlighted the point in the meeting notes below. Can you please clarify.



I have attached the meeting notes for your reference, let me know if anything is missing:



1) The iOS Maps are integrated but it seems the following functionality is either missing or is not working:

a) Take me there button is not working

gtbcorp gtbcorp will integrate take me there button in SDK first and then move onto the other take me there buttons within the app.



b) We tested the maps in the Mall but it was not able to pick up my current location

Carter will get back to us on this



c) There are some UI tweaks that we would need to making owing to the maps that have been integrated. For example notifications section and the top bars in the maps. We would like to discuss them with you so that we choose the best possible route



- We did the tweak you asked  but the nav bar at the bottom expands and contracts

- Notification Section as per Wednesday Design

- Maps left and right scroll

- Map overlays



All UI Tweaks have been discussed and finalised.



Close left/right swipe on the map section - Kumail please confirm if this is okay as it deviates from Wednesday's design.



Exact instructions/steps for taking out the notification section from the app and putting it back into the app in a separate location will be shared by gtbcorp gtbcorp.



2) Android repository was shared with your team and we are waiting on news of Maps integration with Android

Carter will provide feedback on this, they have aljanety started work on the Android build.



3) The Maps need to work offline, we will need to discuss with your team the best possible way to do this and update the maps when an update is available.

Maps work offline, if there is an update the new map loads and downloads itself on clicking the map section.



4) What sort of Analytics are included in the Engage SDK, how can we leverage them to be used with Google Analytics or a tool like Flurry?

According to Carter, Engage SDK has all the required analytics, if more are required at a later date he will provide us with a solution.



5) Hand Off Control - For Parking Steps.

A call back function can be created for the parking functionality.



6) Need to discuss nodes for parking and shortest route

Carter will provide a training session to our team in the next couple of days. The objective of this training would be to setup end nodes etc.



7) All Udids put in except for 4s - build does not work on it

Thats fine.



On a separate note, gtbcorp gtbcorp can provide us with offline navigation and text based instruction if we provide them with the maps - Carter can you please elaborate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feedback points for gtbcorps Products Dear Juzer and Kumail,

It was a really productive 2 weeks and a great learning experience. We have
definitely progressed a lot and as stated before, our team is 100%
dedicated to Dubai Mall to provide the best of our products and support.

As per our several feedback sessions, I've compiled a list of all the
points that I received in past 2 weeks. I am excluding the points for
which, the changes are aljanety made (most of them in Navigate). Please feel
free to add any point that I might have missed.

As conveyed to Kumail, I will go discuss all of them with my team and
provide a replay (with a tentative timeline for changes) by early next week.

- *Social WiFi*
- To be able to track these events/campaigns (like Friday’s event)
for new SSIDs that have been added at the last minute
- Remove Twitter from graphs as we are not using them
- Add the total numbers for each period below the spjanetsheet
- Add New Users along with unique users
- Factor for % of people who use the WiFi
- Adding new users in the chart besides FB and Email
- Daily unique users and overall new custricks
- Provide correlation between the users and the sessions
(authentications)
- In Marketing - add nationality and zones and hours (both with
multiple choices)
- To add Events & Campaigns in Social WiFi for Campaign based tracking
- Comparison in Social WiFi (like comparison in Flow) - for both
zones and time/duration
- To get nationality based on zones (social WiFi) and their trends
- to provide janet-only access to new users
- to see the usage logs for the users who access Social WiFi and Flow
tools
- *Chairman's Dashboard*
- To co-relate the data between the maps/zones and the numbers -
either by adding in labels (like numbers) or colors in the list
- To keep the left and right bars configurable to show or not - so
that they don’t come in with the hover of the mouse
- To stop the zoom out at a certain point
- To change the maps for better visuals
- To change the colours if possible - low priority
- *Feedback on Engage*
- To have maps for beacon search so that it should show where each
beacon is placed
- In the floor mapper, keep the store and beacons names searchable
- To make the number of notifications configurable by the client
- *Flow*
- To provide user creation access to Kumail
- To work on speed as 6 months analysis takes time in minutes -
sometimes even more than 15 mins
- *Navigate* (only the remaining points as per our last demo session)
- Accuracy on points (mostly open spaces) in the mall where the blue
dot loses it’s path by a significant margin
- To show the icons/names of nearby shops always visible in
Navigation mode - also, to increase the significance of amenities
- Work on the Floor transition part in navigation as it’s still seems
like a break in custrick journey and is not as suggestive/clear
- Change of colour of the path aljanety travelled by Blue dot, change
of colour of highlighted icons from orange
- To get the correct and most updated names of stores - *action item
on Mall IT Team and Mall Connect to provide a central repository with
usable API for the maps*
- Update Paths for Floor LG and G - *aljanety updated*
- Provide access of EngageApp to Kumail
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: APIs for Flow & Engage Stats Hi Thimothy,

Things are great here.

We do have API to pull data from Flow and Social WiFi and the Dubai Mall is
using them aljanety. I think Geeta/Samreen/Christina are our points of
contact for that. Please let me know if you would need any further details
on this.

We did get a similar requirement from Kumail on this (adding him in the
loop) - please let us know the requirements and we can get back ASAP.

I request best time to schedule a phone call to discuss the proposal. If

I would like to understand the requirements for email marketing as well as
outline the proposal. The proposal as listed below includes a more than
just email, including customization by engineering team, contacts manager

Fwd: Event Reporting TDM (Eid Al Adha) Carter,

Based on Juzer's response:

Re: Question about Dwell time
- Juzer : Dwell time computed by emaar IT team for last couple of months
using the R tool with minimum 30 mins engaged time was found on average of
150 mins. On eid day it is highly unlikely for a person to enter and exit
the mall in 2 hrs. We need to understand the dwell time calculation logic
applied with all the rules. This will also be checked by Our Internal audit
for accuracy. Please recheck and organize this with kumail.

*Not sure what to respond here, they are familiar with our system and how
it works. Do we need to re-iterate it to them here?*

Re: Cluttered view of zone labels on dashboard

Juzer :We need a Map overhaul with a simpler view . Liaise with Kumail . In
the current view You need to see how to reference the zones with
abbreviations and wrapping text. Another way is providing only zone numbers
and referencing it in a table alongside or below the map in the descending
order of traffic.

*This will have to be manually created and done. I can do this once I'm
back in the office on Friday. I can provide a reference guide to each floor
with only numbers marked out and a supplementary legend with zones
corresponding to the numbers. I think Kumail may have provided this to us
in the past, for us to create the 80 zone dashboard (back in 2016), i'll
dig through my emails to see if this exists.*
Re: Report created from a 40 zoned dashboard

Juzer : By 40 zones , i meant another definition where zones were defined
combining the entire mall into 40 zones. This would also make zone names
legible.


*This will require us to import the AirWave files into the earlier 40 zone
variant of the dashboard, re-add data and re create the report again. As
per your instructions, we were only running this setup from the 80 zone
variant of the dashboard. Your thoughts?*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High Level Project Plan Hi Kumail,

essentials, agreed upon.

You're welcome to add your suggestion and comments as this is on a Google

RE: Urgent Request from Chairman Office Dear Attiqur,

I met with Knowles and the team. Explained them the AP placement guidelines.

We went to most of the stores where APs are aljanety placed and also to all
the stores where AP placements were planned for today.

As far as the proposal goes, we are awaiting an alignment call with Kumail.
We are planning to submit the proposal by Sunday.

Lily
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Important correction change required Dear Juzer,

As an update, #1 has been completed. Now the client now has the option to
change the 'display' names of all the zones. Also, please let me know the
update for #2 and #3 as stated in previous mail (below).

Dear Kumail,

For #1, if you could provide me the display names for zones for any one
specific floor, I will make the changes accordingly. Once the changes are
completed and agreed upon, we can provide the functionality details to the
IT Team.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal for gtbcorps Engage Dear Kumail,

Please find a proposal for the Engage product from gtbcorps, which

- Updated SDK for Android
- Updated SDK for iOS
- Web based UI to create campaigns for push notifications
- Unlimited number of users, campaigns and data

Out of Scope:

- Beacon installation or any hardware maintenance
- Any customizations or additional changes beyond those aljanety in the

We would like to consider option 2 with the web page hosted with Emaar. We do not want not want to be bound for a time period of 3 years and would want a flexibility to move out of the option after 6 months if decided to.

Please test out the solution at the NOC or any other new site and proceed expeditiously.

Kumail / Vipin will work with you to get this moving.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Footfall Heat Map Dear Kumail,

While making this change, our engineers realized that the last airwave
export we have is from April and given the current changes in AP, it is
really important to confirm that all the AP placement are proper. Hence,
could you please provide us the latest airwave export?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Important Reports Required Dear Juzer,

Could you please provide more details on what is the requirement as it's
unclear to our reporting team. You can either provide a small mockup
(similar to what Kumail provided for last report which was really helpful -
it doesn't have to be exact) or we can schedule a phone call for more
clarity.

Based on the requirement, we will provide the timeline as soon as possible.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RE: Address Istanbul Hotspot Dear Lily,

We have been informed that our contractor is aljanety in touch with you but they did not received the proposal yet. To be able to speed up the progress and complete the PO process, we kindly require your support to provide the proposal at the earliest since we have a tight schedule for taking over the project and opening.

Please feel free to reach us if you have any further queries.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Minutes of Meet: Mall view and Connect 1/5/18 Dear Kumail,

Are you referring to the new tab which opens when the gtbcorps logo on the
mall view page is clicked? This was reported in our last call as well. If
yes, then we are working on this and I'll have an update for you soon. If
this is a different occurrence, then please let me know and I'll look into
it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Navigation Experience at TDM Dear Kumail,

We unfortunately can not use AVF files directly. They are Apple's file
format and not an open standard. I know they use GeoJSON as the base, but
it has some Apple specific items. We can not support this file format in
our SDKs. Our SDKs does not use Apple's MapKit and work on Android and iOS.
During Juan's visit to Dubai last summer with Jie, we showed you our SDK
which is based on SVG maps and not Apple's AVF maps.

Secondly the issue is not with the maps, but with use of smoothing and
motion sensor processors by MapKit which is again Apple propitiatory items.
The only way to see the location you are seeing in Point Consulting app is
to use Apple's MapKit.

Again I understand your concerns, but unfortunately we need to work within
the parameters defined by iOS and Android. We can not change those things
even if we wanted to. The OS manufacturers Apple and Google define the
rules of the game and I can not override them.

RE: Weekly Report Mar 6 - Mar 12 Dear Micahel ,

I thought of taking a smaller period from 13/03/2016 to 21/03/2106 , since I had data from you until 12/03/2016 . Yet the report did not give me the required output in the daily summary. Kumail see if you can assist.

RE: Seeking a Commercial Proposal from gtbcorp gtbcorp for Wifi Analytics Solution Dear Kumail,

Can you please comment on contract end date?

Re: Issue list for Navigation Dear Juzer,

I have given a demo to Kumail today and got some feedback which we'll try
to include for tomorrow's demo. I am also providing a link for the video
that I have created today using screengrab to provide a basic overview on
turn by turn navigation. Here is the link: Navigation Over WiFi Testing -
30th May
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/im26noq5mti0azj/iOS%20-%20WiFi%20Navigation%20testing%20-%203.mov?dl=0>

Here are the updates on the issue list and change request as per today:

*Issue List and Change Requests*

1. *Adding of Washrooms and prayer rooms - Updating of shops/locations -* a
few shops are either not mapped or are not updated - though we have done
the integration with Micello, seems like we are not getting the most
updated data from them
- It seems like Micello has changed their API data structure and we
aljanety had issues with their API not providing full data - Carter is
having conversation with their CEO for this - on the parallel, our
engineers are working on this to janet the new data structure
- Timeline - We will provide an update with timeline once Carter is
able to talk with them
- We are able to janet the new data structure - we should have an
updated list of stores soon - updated by EOD Toronto
- The locations have been updated from Micello and Carter has sent a
detailed email with some discrepancy between the website and Micello.
- As per talk with Kumail - we need to follow Micello as a reference
and co-ordinate with Asim (Mall-Connect) for the central repository -
Jesse to co-ordinate with Asim on this and get details for both store
listing, store details, category and updates
- *Jesse is co-ordinating with Asim on this - will keep updated with
progress*
- *As per the Ramco, the Micelle doesn’t follow the central
repository which is used by all other applications - working with Asim on
this*
2. *The paths need to be further updated *- the current paths are better
than before, but still need some smoothening as sometimes the paths go via
the corridor or unreachable areas
- *The Paths have been updated for Floor 1 & 2 - Jesse has tested
this and given the demo to Kumail and Asim*
- *The engineers will update Ground and Lower Ground Floor paths too
- Jesse to get back with the timeline*
3. *Amenities and Stores need to appear earlier while zooming in -* the
amenities and stores appear quite late and the user does not get details on
where they are in the map
- This is a configurable part from gtbcorps servers - if Kumail can
provide the details on level of appearance, we can configure this
from our side
- *As a solution from our side, we would make amenities appear much
earlier and make the other stores appear earlier than before,
Jesse to get
back with timeline soon*
- *Jesse has sent an email to Kumail so that he can co-ordinate with
the Marketing team and provide a detailed excel sheet for details on each
category/type of icons*
- *By the time the overall significance level is provided by the
Marketing team - Jesse to update a few category by himself as a test*
4. *Recalculating Route -* If the user takes a wrong or different route,
they should have an option of recalculating the route from where they are
- *gtbcorps will add a new button to recalculate route in case the
user goes for a different path for a while, Jesse to get back with
timeline soon*
- *Our developers are working on it, timeline: Monday EOD*
5. *To change the floor names to numbers and add amenities button
besides them -* The user should have an option to see all the amenities
on their floor by the click of the button, Kumail has provided the
design for it to Jesse
- *Jesse will work with our engineers and designers and get back
with timeline for this*
- *As per the talk with our team, this change is time consuming,
Jesse to setup a meeting with Kumail and Carter to confirm the timeline*


*Fixed:*


1. *Accuracy of Blue Dot *-the pointer is always a few meters to the
right or left - *the right and left part is fixed now - Jesse has
provided a demo to Kumail and Asim*
- Our engineers are working on the accuracy and Jesse is calibrating
most of the locations in Mall again for this
- Timeline - Tuesday for Second Floor, Wednesday for all floors
- Our engineers have made the changes and the accuracy has improved
for a few places in all the Floor, but still some discrepancy,
specially on
second floor - Jesse is working with Engineers and will keep updating
- Our engineers are doing calibration and redrawing the path for
Second floor - we should see difference after that
- The paths have been redrawn and it helps a lot in beacon based
navigation - for maps, we have realized that the map we are
using (provided
by Aruba/Meridian) and the map provided by Micello have around 10-15
pixel of difference - and hence the accuracy for WiFi is usually 10-15
pixels off.
- Now that we know the reason, our engineers are looking into some
creative solution based on time we have - we will get back to you by EOD
with an update
- *This has been updated to show a more accurate path now - it
follows a better path and doesn’t go inside the corridor (**the
pointer is still a bit jumpy as it sometimes moves to 5-10 pixels while
navigating and our engineers are looking into it)*
- *This has been fixed and the demo has been given to Kumail today -
there would still be minor inconsistencies where the signal strength is
weak and the Engineers would keep working on this as a continued effort*
2. *Movement of the pointer is not smooth - *the experience was much
better for the Apple subsidiary company - Kumail, could we somehow have
the access of this app for reference purpose?
- Our engineers are looking into it, but as suggested above, the
access to the reference app would help a lot for comparison
- Kumail - if possible, on our next testing, I will take a video of
the app so that I can show this to our engineers for comparison and
reference
- The pointer movement has been smoothened, but it is still a bit
choppy as compared to the Apple’s Navigation app - our engineers are
working on it, I will provide an update soon
- *The pointer movement is smoothened - Jesse has tested this
and given a demo to Asim and Kumail and the movement of the blue dot is
much better now*
3. *White text and background for the navigation msg - *he message that
navigation is paused or is active, you are being located is in white text
over white background - so not visible properly
- *This one has been fixed by our engineers - Jesse has tested this,
works fine now (white text with grey background)*
4. *Zoom-in details for shop names* - these should come in a bit early
- *This one has been fixed by our engineers - Jesse has tested this,
the shop names appear earlier.*
- *As this part is configurable from our side - please let us know if
we should further tweak this or if we should add a hierarchy.*
5. *gtbcorps logo* - need to remove
- *This one has been fixed by our engineers - **Jesse has tested
this, the logo is removed*
6. *Check location mapping for LGF* - Jesse will verify this part
- *Jesse has tested and LGF location mapping is working fine*
- *Jesse will test further today to verify all major points*
7. *Thimothy reported an issue related blue dot disappearing*
- Need further details on that one as Jesse is not able to reproduce
it in the mall
8. *Walking direction pointer (on top of the blue dot) is not accurate -
i*f I’m walking straight - it keeps tilting towards either left or right
side - this arrow takes the data from the compass - the direction arrow is
removed now - Jesse has tested this
- This setting seems to be like a problem with the compass as the
arrow is calibrated according to the compass app from the iPhone
- Our engineers are looking into it and Jesse is providing more data
on this from the mall
- Jesse has tested this further and the arrow does calibrates to the
walking direction for WiFi with minor discrepancy (a bit to left or
right sometimes). The arrow uses the device’s accelerometer and
compass to
get this data and hence it is dependent on the device for it’s accuracy,
but seems to be working fairly well overall
- *We have realized that the arrow needs further re-caliberation for
20-30 degrees, we will make this change soon and keep you updated*
- *As per discussion with Kumail and also referencing the Apple’s
navigation app - we have removed the pointer from the blue dot as it is
limited to device’s compass and accelerometer*
9. *Using proper paths for walking instead of the joining points A to B
- *he paths shown to reach from point A to point B do not follow the
proper walking path but just a straight line
- Our team is redrawing all the paths to accommodate corridors
instead of linear pathways
- *Timeline - Tuesday*
- *Our engineers are redrawing the path for Second floor - it should
be completed by their EOD so that we can test this tomorrow morning*
- *The two way paths for both 1st and 2nd Level are added in the
system - Jesse has tested it and it works fine. We would
further fine tune
it as a next step, after the issues are resolved.*
- This has been fixed and tested multiple times - we would need to
smoothen the paths further as per my talk with Kumail during the demo - I
will create another issue for that
10. *You have reached your destination message to be added when the user
reaches their destination -* Added
- *Jesse has tested this and shown to Kumail and Asim during the
demo*
11. *Removing the Floors Page and icon from top right corner -* besides
locate me and search - Fixed
- *The icon has been removed, Jesse has tested this and shown to
Kumail and Asim in demo*
12. *Change the ‘Navigation Paused. Tap to Re-centre’ message to a small
icon with Re-centre text like Google* - when the user moves away from
active navigation, they get a message at the bottom to recenter, to change
that message to a simple design
- Jesse will work with our engineers and designers and get back with
timeline for this
- Our developers are working on it, timeline: Monday
- *This change has been made and Jesse has tested and provided a
demo to Kumail and Asim*

Re: gtbcorps-Splash Page-Proposal Dear Kumail,

We cannot have breaks in user experience as before . We had lot of flak from Sr management . Please suggest next best course of action.

Re: @U By Emaar - WIFI Hi Linto

I understand. Is it possible to share a full API document with requested
examples in that case.

As per the signed work order for Infobip integration, it was agreed as a
one-time effort only. We had not allocated any resources for changes or
troubleshooting on the gtbcorps end. Happy to discuss this on a call.

Given the urgent request, I had managed to have an engineering resource for
a short time to make the changes, but it seems the API is not working
properly. Therefore, having a single proper API document from Infobip will
be of great help. Also if in the future, changes to APIs are made only
after prior notification to everyone consuming the API.

Our implementation, at this point, does not print the request or response
payloads in the logs. We did not implement the debug capabilities as part
of the original work order. We can make changes to print a full log of
request/response in our next engineering sprint cycle which is expected to
take place in the first week of April.

Re: Proposal for 2019 Jan-Jun Dear Kumail,

You have my commitments on points 2 and 3. Regarding point 1

You mentioned, PO will be released for 6 month period and I do not believe
Zabeel / Fountain View will be janety in this time

- *Can we move to a 2 year PO*
- These extensions will require almost 800-1,000 new APs which is a
significant increase. Typically, it is not possible for us to keep the same
price and provide the same support. However, I respect the relationship we
have with you and EMAAR. If there is a way to have a longer PO (2 years),
then we can add these extensions in-scope at no additional cost.
- These extensions will likely not open within the next 6 months
anyways, and I want to provide you a fixed pricing so it does not increase
over a 2 year period. If a longer PO is issued, we will make it independent
of future expansions.

Look forward to any feedback on above.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Issue list for Navigation Dear Juzer,

Today Kumail, Asim and I had a demo of the navigation updates and though we
have progressed a lot in past few days, we still have a some minor issues
and some suggested changes on UI and UX. Based on the feedback from Kumail
today, I have added the new points for changes for better user experience
in this list - hence the current list has grown from 10 to 17 items. I will
keep providing updates on these like before:

*Issue List and Change Requests*


1. *Accuracy of Blue Dot *-the pointer is always a few meters to the
right or left - *the right and left part is fixed now - Jesse has
provided a demo to Kumail and Asim*
- Our engineers are working on the accuracy and Jesse is calibrating
most of the locations in Mall again for this
- Timeline - Tuesday for Second Floor, Wednesday for all floors
- Our engineers have made the changes and the accuracy has improved
for a few places in all the Floor, but still some discrepancy,
specially on
second floor - Jesse is working with Engineers and will keep updating
- Our engineers are doing calibration and redrawing the path for
Second floor - we should see difference after that
- The paths have been redrawn and it helps a lot in beacon based
navigation - for maps, we have realized that the map we are
using (provided
by Aruba/Meredian) and the map provided by Micello have around 10-15
pixel of difference - and hence the accuracy for WiFi is usually 10-15
pixels off.
- Now that we know the reason, our engineers are looking into some
creative solution based on time we have - we will get back to you by EOD
with an update
- *This has been updated to show a more accurate path now - it
follows a better path and doesn’t go inside the corridor (**the
pointer is still a bit jumpy as it sometimes moves to 5-10 pixels while
navigating and our engineers are looking into it)*
2. *Adding of Washrooms and prayer rooms - Updating of shops/locations -*

- It seems like Micello has changed their API data structure and we
aljanety had issues with their API not providing full data - Carter is

engineers are working on this to janet the new data structure
- Timeline - We will provide an update with timeline once Carter is
able to talk with them
- We are able to janet the new data structure - we should have an
updated list of stores soon - updated by EOD Toronto
- *The locations have been updated from **Micello and Carter has sent
a detailed email with some descripency between the website and Micello. *
- *As per talk with Kumail - we need to follow Micello as a reference
and co-ordinate with Asim (Mall-Connect) for the central repository -
Jesse to co-ordinate with Asim on this and get details for both store

3. *Movement of the pointer is not smooth - *the experience was much

6. *Recalculating Route -* If the user takes a wrong or different route,
they should have an option of recalculating the route from where they are
- *gtbcorps will add a new button to recalculate route in case the
user goes for a different path for a while, Jesse to get back with
timeline soon*
7. *Change the ‘Navigation Paused. Tap to Re-centre’ message to a small
icon with Re-centre text like Google* - when the user moves away from
active navigation, they get a message at the bottom to recenter, to change
that message to a simple design
- *Jesse will work with our engineers and designers and get back
with timeline for this*
8. *To change the floor names to numbers and add amenities button
besides them -* The user should have an option to see all the amenities
on their floor by the click of the button, Kumail has provided the
design for it to Jesse
- *Jesse will work with our engineers and designers and get back
with timeline for this*


*Fixed:*


1. *White text and background for the navigation msg - *he message that
navigation is paused or is active, you are being located is in white text
over white background - so not visible properly
- *This one has been fixed by our engineers - Jesse has tested this,
works fine now (white text with grey background)*
2. *Zoom-in details for shop names* - these should come in a bit early
- *This one has been fixed by our engineers - Jesse has tested this,
the shop names appear earlier.*
- *As this part is configurable from our side - please let us know if
we should further tweak this or if we should add a hierarchy.*
3. *gtbcorps logo* - need to remove
- *This one has been fixed by our engineers - **Jesse has tested
this, the logo is removed*
4. *Check location mapping for LGF* - Jesse will verify this part
- *Jesse has tested and LGF location mapping is working fine*
- *Jesse will test further today to verify all major points*
5. *Thimothy reported an issue related blue dot disappearing*
- Need further details on that one as Jesse is not able to reproduce
it in the mall
6. *Walking direction pointer (on top of the blue dot) is not accurate -
i*f I’m walking straight - it keeps tilting towards either left or right
side - this arrow takes the data from the compass - the direction arrow is
removed now - Jesse has tested this
- This setting seems to be like a problem with the compass as the
arrow is calibrated according to the compass app from the iPhone
- Our engineers are looking into it and Jesse is providing more data
on this from the mall
- Jesse has tested this further and the arrow does calibrates to the
walking direction for WiFi with minor discrepancy (a bit to left or
right sometimes). The arrow uses the device’s accelerometer and
compass to
get this data and hence it is dependent on the device for it’s accuracy,
but seems to be working fairly well overall
- *We have realized that the arrow needs further re-caliberation for
20-30 degrees, we will make this change soon and keep you updated*
- *As per discussion with Kumail and also referencing the Apple’s
navigation app - we have removed the pointer from the blue dot as it is
limited to device’s compass and accelerometer*
7. *Using proper paths for walking instead of the joining points A to B
- *he paths shown to reach from point A to point B do not follow the
proper walking path but just a sraight line
- Our team is redrawing all the paths to accommodate corridors
instead of linear pathways
- *Timeline - Tuesday*
- *Our engineers are redrawing the path for Second floor - it should
be completed by their EOD so that we can test this tomorrow morning*
- *The two way paths for both 1st and 2nd Level are added in the
system - Jesse has tested it and it works fine. We would
further fine tune
it as a next step, after the issues are resolved.*
- This has been fixed and tested multiple times - we would need to
smoothen the paths further as per my talk with Kumail during the demo - I
will create another issue for that
8. *You have reached your destination message to be added when the user
reaches their destination -* Added
- *Jesse has tested this and shown to Kumail and Asim during the
demo*
9. *Removing the Floors Page and icon from top right corner -* besides
locate me and search - Fixed
- *The icon has been removed, Jesse has tested this and shown to
Kumail and Asim in demo*

Re: Very Important Update on Chairman's Dashboard Dear Kumail,

My apologies.
The last mail had Screenshots from the earlier version of the dashboard.
Attached are the screenshots from the latest DashBoard.

Our Engineers are still working on it, and as mentioned before it would be
delivered next Tuesday.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Issue list for Navigation Dear Juzer,

Our team has worked over the weekend for the below issues and here are the
updates with timelines for most of the remaining issues/change requests:

*Issue List and Change Requests*


1. *Accuracy of Blue Dot *-the pointer is always a few meters to the
right or left - *the right and left part is fixed now - Jesse has
provided a demo to Kumail and Asim*
- Our engineers are working on the accuracy and Jesse is calibrating
most of the locations in Mall again for this
- Timeline - Tuesday for Second Floor, Wednesday for all floors
- Our engineers have made the changes and the accuracy has improved
for a few places in all the Floor, but still some discrepancy,
specially on
second floor - Jesse is working with Engineers and will keep updating
- Our engineers are doing calibration and redrawing the path for
Second floor - we should see difference after that
- The paths have been redrawn and it helps a lot in beacon based
navigation - for maps, we have realized that the map we are
using (provided
by Aruba/Meredian) and the map provided by Micello have around 10-15
pixel of difference - and hence the accuracy for WiFi is usually 10-15
pixels off.
- Now that we know the reason, our engineers are looking into some
creative solution based on time we have - we will get back to you by EOD
with an update
- *This has been updated to show a more accurate path now - it
follows a better path and doesn’t go inside the corridor (**the
pointer is still a bit jumpy as it sometimes moves to 5-10 pixels while
navigating and our engineers are looking into it)*
2. *Adding of Washrooms and prayer rooms - Updating of shops/locations -* a
few shops are either not mapped or are not updated - though we have done
the integration with Micello, seems like we are not getting the most
updated data from them
- It seems like Micello has changed their API data structure and we
aljanety had issues with their API not providing full data - Carter is
having conversation with their CEO for this - on the parallel, our
engineers are working on this to janet the new data structure
- Timeline - We will provide an update with timeline once Carter is
able to talk with them
- We are able to janet the new data structure - we should have an
updated list of stores soon - updated by EOD Toronto
- *The locations have been updated from **Micello and Carter has sent
a detailed email with some descripency between the website and Micello. *
- *As per talk with Kumail - we need to follow Micello as a reference
and co-ordinate with Asim (Mall-Connect) for the central repository -
Jesse to co-ordinate with Asim on this and get details for both store
listing, store details, category and updates *
- *Jesse is co-ordinating with Asim on this - will keep updated with
progress*
3. *Movement of the pointer is not smooth - *the experience was much
better for the Apple subsidiary company - Kumail, could we somehow have
the access of this app for reference purpose?
- Our engineers are looking into it, but as suggested above, the
access to the reference app would help a lot for comparison
- Kumail - if possible, on our next testing, I will take a video of
the app so that I can show this to our engineers for comparison and
reference
- *The pointer movement has been smoothened, but it is still a bit
choppy as compared to the Apple’s Navigation app - our engineers are
working on it, I will provide an update soon*
- *The pointer movement is smoothened - Jesse will test this today
and provide updates*
4. *The paths need to be further updated *- the current paths are better
than before, but still need some smoothening as sometimes the paths go via
the corridor or unreachable areas
- *The Paths have been updated - Jesse to test this today and
provide updates*
5. *Amenities and Stores need to appear earlier while zooming in -* the
amenities and stores appear quite late and the user does not get details on
where they are in the map
- This is a configurable part from gtbcorps servers - if Kumail can
provide the details on level of appearance, we can configure this
from our side
- *As a solution from our side, we would make amenities appear much
earlier and make the other stores appear earlier than before,
Jesse to get
back with timeline soon*
- *Jesse has sent an email to Kumail so that he can co-ordinate with
the Marketing team and provide a detailed excel sheet for details on each
category/type of icons*
6. *Recalculating Route -* If the user takes a wrong or different route,
they should have an option of recalculating the route from where they are
- *gtbcorps will add a new button to recalculate route in case the
user goes for a different path for a while, Jesse to get back with
timeline soon*
- *Our developers are working on it, timeline: Monday*
7. *Change the ‘Navigation Paused. Tap to Re-centre’ message to a small
icon with Re-centre text like Google* - when the user moves away from
active navigation, they get a message at the bottom to recenter, to change
that message to a simple design
- *Jesse will work with our engineers and designers and get back
with timeline for this*
- *Our developers are working on it, timeline: Monday*
8. *To change the floor names to numbers and add amenities button
besides them -* The user should have an option to see all the amenities
on their floor by the click of the button, Kumail has provided the
design for it to Jesse
- *Jesse will work with our engineers and designers and get back
with timeline for this*
- *As per the talk with our team, this change is time consuming,
Jesse to setup a meeting with Kumail and Carter to confirm the timeline*


*Fixed:*


1. *White text and background for the navigation msg - *he message that
navigation is paused or is active, you are being located is in white text
over white background - so not visible properly
- *This one has been fixed by our engineers - Jesse has tested this,
works fine now (white text with grey background)*
2. *Zoom-in details for shop names* - these should come in a bit early
- *This one has been fixed by our engineers - Jesse has tested this,
the shop names appear earlier.*
- *As this part is configurable from our side - please let us know if
we should further tweak this or if we should add a hierarchy.*
3. *gtbcorps logo* - need to remove
- *This one has been fixed by our engineers - **Jesse has tested
this, the logo is removed*
4. *Check location mapping for LGF* - Jesse will verify this part
- *Jesse has tested and LGF location mapping is working fine*
- *Jesse will test further today to verify all major points*
5. *Thimothy reported an issue related blue dot disappearing*

Re: Invoice # 236-16 (MAP SDK) Dear Kumail,

We can have a call, please advise when. Perhaps in about 3 hours from now.

Regarding the app, we will share the app with wayfinding today as agreed.
Please share the Excel spjanetsheet with timelines. My understanding is that
the UAT will be focused on the wayfinding feature with two options; and the
bluedot will be two weeks later followed by bluedot+autofollow after that.

Re: Time slot of a meeting Dear Kumail,

This is still pending from our end, can we discuss and close this in the
current week.

Please let me know your preferred time and date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Navigation Experience at TDM Dear Kumail,

We can discuss on phone. It will not be possible for Jesse to extend the
visit because of other important commitments. Furthermore, he has completed
a survey of the mall thoroughly and on-ground presence will not help in any
manner. Regarding the finances, we can try to find a way -- as you know for
us at gtbcorps the most important thing is to deliver the best we can
irrespective of money (e.g., we have not charged any money for navigate
project so far despite a lot of customization being done).

We are obviously committed to support the TDM team. Given that Juan is also
scheduled to visit there in about a week's time, he can also capture
further requirements.

RE: Important queries? Dear Carter,
As agreed with Kumail, kindly share the latest SDK to enable  the message to display in  4 rows? .

of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the 
same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection 
law. 

3.           The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of 
legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data 
importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be 
entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b). 

Clause 9 

Governing Law 

These clauses shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, 

with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the 



 

 

Third Party Data Processing Agreement-New Contract 

 

 Version 1.0 Page 13/16 

 

Classified: Internal 

data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that 

clause. 

Clause 10 

Variation of the contract 

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from 
adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the 
Clause. 

Clause 11 

Subprocessing 

1.           The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed 
on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data 
exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent 
of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which 
imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the 
Clauses [3]. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written 
agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the 
sub-processor's obligations under such agreement. 

2.           The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall 
also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data 
subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against 
the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to 
exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal 
obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party 
liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. 

3.           The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract 

referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is 

established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal 

data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer 

under that clause. 

4.           The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under 
the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at 
least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory 
authority. 

Clause 12 

Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services 

1.           The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing 
services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all 
the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the 
personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon 
the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. 
In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data 
transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore. 

2.           The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data 
exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit 
of the measures referred to in paragraph 1. 

On behalf of the data exporter:

[1]        Parties may reproduce definitions and meanings contained in Directive 95/46/EC within 
this Clause if they considered it better for the contract to stand alone. 

[2]          Mandatory requirements of the national legislation applicable to the data importer 
which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society on the basis of one of the 
interests listed in Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46/EC, that is, if they constitute a necessary measure 
to safeguard national security, defense, public security, the prevention, investigation, detection and 
prosecution of criminal offences or of breaches of ethics for the regulated professions, an important 
economic or financial interest of the State or the protection of the data subject or the rights and 
freedoms of others, are not in contradiction with the standard contractual clauses. Some examples 
of such mandatory requirements which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society 
are, inter alia, internationally recognised sanctions, tax-reporting requirements or anti-money-
laundering reporting requirements. 

[3]          This requirement may be satisfied by the subprocessor co-signing the contract 
entered into between the data exporter and the data importer under this Decision.

HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.

Clause 1
Definitions
For the purposes of the Clauses:
(a)         	'personal data', 'special categories of data', 'process/processing', 'controller', 'processor', 'data subject' and 'supervisory authority' shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[1];
(b)        	'the data exporter' means the controller who transfers the personal data;
(c)         	'the data importer' means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country's system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;
(d)        	'the subprocessor' means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other subprocessor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other subprocessor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;
(e)         	'the applicable data protection law' means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established;
(f)         	'technical and organisational security measures' means those measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.
Clause 2
Details of the transfer
The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses.
Clause 3
Third-party beneficiary clause
1.          	The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary.
2.          	The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity.
3.          	The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
4.          	The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law.
Clause 4
Obligations of the data exporter
The data exporter agrees and warrants:
(a)         	that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State;
(b)        	that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses;
(c)         	that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract;
(d)        	that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation;
(e)         	that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;
(f)         	that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC;
(g)         	to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension;
(h)        	to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information;
(i)          	that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and
(j)          	that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i).
Clause 5
Obligations of the data importer [2]
The data importer agrees and warrants:
(a)         	to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;
(b)        	that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;
(c)         	that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred;
(d)        	that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:
(i)    	any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation,
(ii)   	any accidental or unauthorised access, and
(iii)  	any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so;
(e)         	to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred;
(f)         	at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority;
(g)         	to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;
(h)        	that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent;
(i)          	that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11;
(j)          	to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.
Clause 6
Liability
1.          	The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.
2.          	If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.
The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.
3.          	If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
Clause 7
Mediation and jurisdiction
1.          	The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:
(a)   	to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;
(b)   	to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
2.          	The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.
Clause 8
Cooperation with supervisory authorities
1.          	The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.
2.          	The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.
3.          	The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).
Clause 9
Governing Law
These clauses shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that clause.
Clause 10
Variation of the contract
The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.
Clause 11
Subprocessing
1.          	The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses [3]. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor's obligations under such agreement.
2.          	The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
3.          	The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that clause.
4.          	The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority.
Clause 12
Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services
1.          	The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
2.          	The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE 
Liability
The parties agree that if one party is held liable for a violation of the clauses committed by the other party, the latter will, to the extent to which it is liable, indemnify the first party for any cost, charge, damages, expenses or loss it has incurred.
Indemnification is contingent upon:
(a)         	the data exporter promptly notifying the data importer of a claim; and
(b)        	the data importer being given the possibility to cooperate with the data exporter in the defense and settlement of the claim[4].
 
 


[1]       	Parties may reproduce definitions and meanings contained in Directive 95/46/EC within this Clause if they considered it better for the contract to stand alone.
[2]         	Mandatory requirements of the national legislation applicable to the data importer which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society on the basis of one of the interests listed in Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46/EC, that is, if they constitute a necessary measure to safeguard national security, defense, public security, the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of breaches of ethics for the regulated professions, an important economic or financial interest of the State or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others, are not in contradiction with the standard contractual clauses. Some examples of such mandatory requirements which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society are, inter alia, internationally recognised sanctions, tax-reporting requirements or anti-money-laundering reporting requirements.
[3]         	This requirement may be satisfied by the subprocessor co-signing the contract entered into between the data exporter and the data importer under this Decision.
[4]         	Paragraph on liabilities is optional.

Fwd: Data Hosting and Data Access for TDM Thanks Carter,

Looping Atiqur into the communication.

1) As per management request data should be available from mid June 2015 , since we started , irrespective of data quality. Can we provide that as well to Neumann as well for internal storage. Please confirm.

2) If we start with option 3 for raw data, can the data first come to Emaar and then go to gtbcorp labs for processing ? Is there any disadvantage with this approach ? For processed data it will obviously be from gtbcorp labs to a Emaar. Let me know the time it will take to do the needful as I have got only the coming week to complete this activity.

3)From a bandwidth and investment point of view what does it mean for real-time and end of day processing.

4)If we go for option 3 now what is the effort to switch to option 2 for in-house hosting later.

I Will appreciate your prompt response as i am requiring my team to compute the capex and opex investments needed for your option 3 and 2 below along with a time schedule implementation for management approval.

Introduction
	Introduction

	In order to comply with the following legal requirements under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Emaar must ensure that any person (whether individually or on behalf of an organization) processing personal data on Emaar’s behalf (a data processor) can provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures governing the processing to be carried out and take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with those measures.

	·         Article 28, “Processor,” requires contractual protections with data processors and their sub-processors, adequate data protection, and production of evidence of compliance with the GDPR; 
	·         Article 30, “Records of processing activities,” requires data processors to maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller;
	·         Article 32, “Security of processing,” requires data processors and their sub-processors to implement comprehensive information security controls to protect EU personal data;
	·         Article 33, “Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority,” requires data processors to report compromises of EU personal data to their clients without undue delay; and
	·         Article 36, “Prior consultation,” requires data processors to provide data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) to their clients in certain high-risk situations. 

	Any data processor who has access (directly or indirectly) to personal data held by Emaar must complete this questionnaire and where directed, provide evidence showing how they meet the necessary security standards for protecting personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.

	Persons processing data on behalf of Emaar which will not have access to personal data (a third party), may still be required to complete this questionnaire if they have access to sensitive business information or business critical systems.

	Instructions to data processors and third parties

	1.  This questionnaire must be completed by the individual responsible for Information Security within the company or business tendering for the work being contracted out by Emaar.

	2.  This questionnaire consists of two columns; the first column lists the security questions and the second column requires the data processor or third party to provide their response to the questions. Data Processors and third parties must not modify or delete any questions. If the question does not apply to the services or work that is to be provided, then an “N/A” (not applicable) in the response column is sufficient.

	3.  Please complete this questionnaire as fully as possible and provide as much information as you are able to. Incomplete or partial answers may result in additional questions and can delay the process. Once the form has been completed, return it to the designated project lead involved in this contract.

	Important note

	In 2013, Emaar received compliance status with the Information Security Standard ISO27001. In order to continue to meet compliance with this standard and to meet its security obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation, Emaar cannot allow persons access to its information or systems, unless they can provide the same or higher levels of protection to its data.

	Companies or other persons who cannot provide Emaar with sufficient guarantees in respect of their technical and organisational security measures, will not be given access to Emaar’s information or systems, until they meet the necessary standards. Responses to this Security Questionnaire will be considered and a decision will be reached as to whether the company’s security standards are sufficient, based on the level of sensitivity of the information or data that would be processed.

2. Implementation & Setup 

As part of the implementation, Aislelabs will set up an organization for each business unit on the dashboard 

with a standard splash page for each business unit.  

In Scope (Splash Page Setup): 

• It is assumed that all sites will follow the same user journey for the splash page. The user journey will 

consist of a single splash screen with login options, a single error page to be displayed in case of an 

error, and a single success page to display when the user authentication is complete and to repeat users. 

• Aislelabs will set up this user journey with a standardized splash page with design as depicted in 

Appendix II. 

• It is assumed that any changes to the splash page for changing the artwork and logos will be conducted 

by the Emaar team using the self-serve portal editor. 

In Scope (Network Setup): 

a. Aislelabs network consultant will assist with integration of 3 sites, as selected by the Customer. This will 
provide the opportunity for the Customer to learn the integration process. Aislelabs will provide 
standardized documentation on integration and self-serve troubleshooting information. The Customer 
will finalize the exact user journey (with or without L2 Mac Auth) before beginning the integration 
process; and the same will be configured across all sites. 

b. The integration document will list out the prerequisites & process of integration including changes to 
the firewall and licenses for the WiFi controller, if any. It is assumed that the Customer is responsible for 
making these changes prior to integration start. 

c. Once the list of sites has been provided by the Customer, Aislelabs will provide SWID (Social WiFi ID) 
generated from the Aislelabs portal post which the rest of the integration would be handled by the 
Customer. Similar process will be followed for any new site additions. 

d. After the integration of the 3 sites, if additional assistance is needed from Aislelabs network consultant 
to conduct the integration, it will be based on a custom work order as explained later in this document. 

 
Out of Scope: 

a. Troubleshooting any network, firewall or hardware infrastructure issues would be handled by the 

Customer. 

b. Integrating with controller once SWID has been provided would be handled by the Customer 

c. Splash page modifications/editing  

3. User Access & Training 

Emaar IT will identify 2-3 admin users for each business unit. Aislelabs would enable access for these users for 

the respective business unit. 

In Scope 

a. Admin users will have access to Manage users page to provide access to any additional users for 
individual sites & manage their access level 

b. Initially Aislelabs would provide 4 training sessions. Multiple users can attend these sessions where-in 

topics on setting up splash pages & accessing guest information, demographic profile etc will be covered. 

The Customer can choose to record the training sessions if needed. 

c. Self-serve FAQs & Help section will be available for use by the end users for the Customer.

4. Product Features & Scope 

As part of this proposal, Aislelabs will configure a standardized splash page for each business unit. 

Standardized splash page journey will include mandatory capture of guest phone number on the 

splash page with the option to login either with Facebook or Email. The email login page will 

mandatorily capture first name, last name & email address of the guest. If the guest chooses to 

login using Facebook, public information made available by Facebook upon login will be captured. 

Customer to inform for any changes to this standard splash page format before beginning of the 

contract period.

additional images or videos 
- Include background images or colors to match your brand identity for the entire splash page or 

the login content block

- Capture any custom information about guests using custom text input or custom selector 

fields. 
- Progressive profiling feature to build up on guest profiles using custom questions during 

subsequent visits. Custom rules can be set to capture additional information about guests on 
every visit after their very first login 

- Multiple languages such as Arabic, English, Chinese and Russian are supported. It is assumed 
that end users for the Customer will use the portal editor to upload text in each language. 

e. L2 Mac Authentication for seamless guest login journey would be available for Aruba 

infrastructure and may not be available for other infrastructure types. If enabled, the guests 

will not see any success page or splash page when they return back to the site after having 

connected once. This option, if enabled, will be configured to remember a user for up-to 1,000 

days as long they use the same phone. Click here for the detailed guide to understand how L2 

Mac Authentication works.

www.aislelabs.com 

 

2. Implementation & Setup 

As part of the implementation, Aislelabs will set up an organization for each business unit on the dashboard 

with a standard splash page for each business unit.  

In Scope (Splash Page Setup): 

• It is assumed that all sites will follow the same user journey for the splash page. The user journey will 

consist of a single splash screen with login options, a single error page to be displayed in case of an 

error, and a single success page to display when the user authentication is complete and to repeat users. 

• Aislelabs will set up this user journey with a standardized splash page with design as depicted in 

Appendix II. 

• It is assumed that any changes to the splash page for changing the artwork and logos will be conducted 

by the Emaar team using the self-serve portal editor. 

In Scope (Network Setup): 

a. Aislelabs network consultant will assist with integration of 3 sites, as selected by the Customer. This will 
provide the opportunity for the Customer to learn the integration process. Aislelabs will provide 
standardized documentation on integration and self-serve troubleshooting information. The Customer 
will finalize the exact user journey (with or without L2 Mac Auth) before beginning the integration 
process; and the same will be configured across all sites. 

b. The integration document will list out the prerequisites & process of integration including changes to 
the firewall and licenses for the WiFi controller, if any. It is assumed that the Customer is responsible for 
making these changes prior to integration start. 

c. Once the list of sites has been provided by the Customer, Aislelabs will provide SWID (Social WiFi ID) 
generated from the Aislelabs portal post which the rest of the integration would be handled by the 
Customer. Similar process will be followed for any new site additions. 

d. After the integration of the 3 sites, if additional assistance is needed from Aislelabs network consultant 
to conduct the integration, it will be based on a custom work order as explained later in this document. 

 
Out of Scope: 

a. Troubleshooting any network, firewall or hardware infrastructure issues would be handled by the 

Customer. 

b. Integrating with controller once SWID has been provided would be handled by the Customer 

c. Splash page modifications/editing  

3. User Access & Training 

Emaar IT will identify 2-3 admin users for each business unit. Aislelabs would enable access for these users for 

the respective business unit. 

In Scope 

a. Admin users will have access to Manage users page to provide access to any additional users for 
individual sites & manage their access level 

b. Initially Aislelabs would provide 4 training sessions. Multiple users can attend these sessions where-in 

topics on setting up splash pages & accessing guest information, demographic profile etc will be covered. 

The Customer can choose to record the training sessions if needed. 

c. Self-serve FAQs & Help section will be available for use by the end users for the Customer.

www.aislelabs.com 

 

 

Out of Scope: 

a. Any additional training would be charged as per charges mentioned in Appendix I 

b. Enabling access for any additional users which requires Aislelabs to conduct the same would 

be charged as per charged mentioned in Appendix I 

c. User access will be provided using user/password-based login; any integrations with Identity 

Provider or SSO systems is out of scope. 

d. Any password related login issues by end users to be addressed by Admin users for the 

Customer through Manage Users page 

4. Product Features & Scope 

As part of this proposal, Aislelabs will configure a standardized splash page for each business unit. 

Standardized splash page journey will include mandatory capture of guest phone number on the 

splash page with the option to login either with Facebook or Email. The email login page will 

mandatorily capture first name, last name & email address of the guest. If the guest chooses to 

login using Facebook, public information made available by Facebook upon login will be captured. 

Customer to inform for any changes to this standard splash page format before beginning of the 

contract period. 

In Scope: 

a. Custom Splash page creation for each site based on the standardized Splash Page journey 
provided using drag and drop portal editor 

- Option for email login along with other Social Login for guests (Facebook etc.) 
- Craft customizable landing or success pages using Aislelabs’ built-in portal editor to include 

additional images or videos 
- Include background images or colors to match your brand identity for the entire splash page or 

the login content block 
- Capture demographic data using form fields like Age, Gender, Nationality 
- Capture any custom information about guests using custom text input or custom selector 

fields. 
- Progressive profiling feature to build up on guest profiles using custom questions during 

subsequent visits. Custom rules can be set to capture additional information about guests on 
every visit after their very first login 

- Multiple languages such as Arabic, English, Chinese and Russian are supported. It is assumed 
that end users for the Customer will use the portal editor to upload text in each language. 

e. L2 Mac Authentication for seamless guest login journey would be available for Aruba 

infrastructure and may not be available for other infrastructure types. If enabled, the guests 

will not see any success page or splash page when they return back to the site after having 

connected once. This option, if enabled, will be configured to remember a user for up-to 1,000 

days as long they use the same phone. Click here for the detailed guide to understand how L2 

Mac Authentication works.

business unit/property’s requirements. 
 
During the training session provided by Customer Success Managers from Aislelabs, each of the components for Splash 
page would be explained.  
 

 

Default Login Page          Email Login Page             Default Success Page               Error Page 
 
 
The standard splash page journey would consist of 4 key parts: 

1. Default Login Page: This would be the first login page that guests will see when they try to connect to WiFi. 
This can be customized further to capture additional information using progressive profiling or to provide more 
personalized experience using different rules.  

2. Email Login Page: If a guest chooses the ‘Login with Email’ option, he/she will be redirected to the email login 
page. Once he successfully enters his details, he will be redirected to the Success Page. 

3. Success Page: Once the guest has successfully logged in either using Facebook or Email or any additional 
social WiFi login option configured on the splash page, he/she will be redirected to a success page. Success 
page can also be used to redirect users to external websites or to display promotional content using images or 
videos. 

4. Error Page: If the guest fails to login using available login options on the splash page, he/she will be redirected 
to an Error page where he can click and go back to the splash page.

Splash Page Troubleshooting: 

The following steps should be taken by Customer helpdesk prior to escalating Splash Page issues raised by an end user 
to Aislelabs helpdesk: 

1. Check that there has not been any changes made to the existing network infrastructure 
a. Added or removed access points, controllers, firewalls, etc. 
b. Changed settings on hardware listed above (ie. added new firewall restriction) 

2. Check the impact of the issue 
a. Is it affecting one client or multiple users? 
b. If it is affecting multiple clients are there any commonalities (ie. only iOS devices)? 
c. Customer helpdesk to check if the issue is replicable or if they can successfully authenticate to the 

guest WiFi. 
d. Is it affecting a specific authentication method (Facebook vs email)? 

3. Identify what part of the standard splash page journey is affected 
a. Is the WiFi SSID visible? 

i. If not, this is most likely a network issue. Check controller. 
b. Does the login page display after associating with the SSID? 

i. Try testing near an access point to check for dead zones. 
c. Does the success page display after authenticating? 

i. Try testing near an access point to check for dead zones. 
d. Does the redirect URL appear after the success page? 

 
After all of the above steps have been taken, please escalate to Aislelabs helpdesk with the following information: 

1. What property the issue is affecting 
a. Specific part of the property vs the whole property 

2. When the issue was first reported 
3. How many devices are affected 
4. What devices are affected 

a. Device type 
b. Device OS 

5. Where in the standard splash page journey the issue is happening 
6. Attach any relevant screenshots or screen recordings

Aislelabs Connect - Scope of Work for Emaar Group 

- Project Background and Description 

Aislelabs currently provides its Flow location analytics platform to Emaar Malls. Emaar Group is 

interested in implementing Aislelabs Connect product at 36 of its properties. This document will 

highlight the scope of Aislelabs Connect implementation for Emaar Group. 

- Definitions 

Customer refers to EMAAR Group 

Vendor refers to Aislelabs 

Guest(s) refers to the user of free WiFi services provided by Emaar Group 

1. Properties & Infrastructure

2. Implementation & Setup 

As part of the implementation, Aislelabs will set up an organization for each business unit on the dashboard 

with a standard splash page for each business unit.  

In Scope (Splash Page Setup): 

• It is assumed that all sites will follow the same user journey for the splash page. The user journey will 

consist of a single splash screen with login options, a single error page to be displayed in case of an 

error, and a single success page to display when the user authentication is complete and to repeat users. 

• Aislelabs will set up this user journey with a standardized splash page with design as depicted in 

Appendix II. 

• It is assumed that any changes to the splash page for changing the artwork and logos will be conducted 

by the Emaar team using the self-serve portal editor. 

In Scope (Network Setup): 

a. Aislelabs network consultant will assist with integration of 3 sites, as selected by the Customer. This will 
provide the opportunity for the Customer to learn the integration process. Aislelabs will provide 
standardized documentation on integration and self-serve troubleshooting information. The Customer 
will finalize the exact user journey (with or without L2 Mac Auth) before beginning the integration 
process; and the same will be configured across all sites. 

b. The integration document will list out the prerequisites & process of integration including changes to 
the firewall and licenses for the WiFi controller, if any. It is assumed that the Customer is responsible for 
making these changes prior to integration start. 

c. Once the list of sites has been provided by the Customer, Aislelabs will provide SWID (Social WiFi ID) 
generated from the Aislelabs portal post which the rest of the integration would be handled by the 
Customer. Similar process will be followed for any new site additions. 

d. After the integration of the 3 sites, if additional assistance is needed from Aislelabs network consultant 
to conduct the integration, it will be based on a custom work order as explained later in this document. 

 
Out of Scope: 

a. Troubleshooting any network, firewall or hardware infrastructure issues would be handled by the 

Customer. 

b. Integrating with controller once SWID has been provided would be handled by the Customer 

c. Splash page modifications/editing  

3. User Access & Training 

Emaar IT will identify 2-3 admin users for each business unit. Aislelabs would enable access for these users for 

the respective business unit. 

In Scope 

a. Admin users will have access to Manage users page to provide access to any additional users for 
individual sites & manage their access level 

b. Initially Aislelabs would provide 4 training sessions. Multiple users can attend these sessions where-in 

topics on setting up splash pages & accessing guest information, demographic profile etc will be covered. 

The Customer can choose to record the training sessions if needed. 

c. Self-serve FAQs & Help section will be available for use by the end users for the Customer.

www.aislelabs.com 

 

 

Out of Scope: 

a. Any additional training would be charged as per charges mentioned in Appendix I 

b. Enabling access for any additional users which requires Aislelabs to conduct the same would 

be charged as per charged mentioned in Appendix I 

c. User access will be provided using user/password-based login; any integrations with Identity 

Provider or SSO systems is out of scope. 

d. Any password related login issues by end users to be addressed by Admin users for the 

Customer through Manage Users page 

4. Product Features & Scope 

As part of this proposal, Aislelabs will configure a standardized splash page for each business unit. 

Standardized splash page journey will include mandatory capture of guest phone number on the 

splash page with the option to login either with Facebook or Email. The email login page will

	·         Article 33, “Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority,” requires data processors to report compromises of EU personal data to their clients without undue delay; and
	·         Article 36, “Prior consultation,” requires data processors to provide data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) to their clients in certain high-risk situations. 

	Any data processor who has access (directly or indirectly) to personal data held by Emaar must complete this questionnaire and where directed, provide evidence showing how they meet the necessary security standards for protecting personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.

	Persons processing data on behalf of Emaar which will not have access to personal data (a third party), may still be required to complete this questionnaire if they have access to sensitive business information or business critical systems.

	Instructions to data processors and third parties

	1.  This questionnaire must be completed by the individual responsible for Information Security within the company or business tendering for the work being contracted out by Emaar.

	2.  This questionnaire consists of two columns; the first column lists the security questions and the second column requires the data processor or third party to provide their response to the questions. Data Processors and third parties must not modify or delete any questions. If the question does not apply to the services or work that is to be provided, then an “N/A” (not applicable) in the response column is sufficient.

	3.  Please complete this questionnaire as fully as possible and provide as much information as you are able to. Incomplete or partial answers may result in additional questions and can delay the process. Once the form has been completed, return it to the designated project lead involved in this contract.

	Important note

	In 2013, Emaar received compliance status with the Information Security Standard ISO27001. In order to continue to meet compliance with this standard and to meet its security obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation, Emaar cannot allow persons access to its information or systems, unless they can provide the same or higher levels of protection to its data.

	Companies or other persons who cannot provide Emaar with sufficient guarantees in respect of their technical and organisational security measures, will not be given access to Emaar’s information or systems, until they meet the necessary standards. Responses to this Security Questionnaire will be considered and a decision will be reached as to whether the company’s security standards are sufficient, based on the level of sensitivity of the information or data that would be processed.

Aislelabs Flow Platform –  

Aislelabs Flow analytics is a cloud-based advanced WiFi analytics platform for 

understanding the behavior of visitors within the premises. It provides actionable insights 

on visitors based on dwell time, spaces visited etc. 

 

1) Visits: Corresponds to the number of visitors who entered the location during the 

selected period.  The overall number includes those visitors who entered more than 

one time during the selected period as well (counted as multiple visits) 

 

2) Dwell Time: Corresponds to the overall average amount of time spent by visitors at 

the location for the selected period.  

 

3) Customer Loyalty: Corresponds to the percentage of visitors who have visited the 

property previously (in a customizable window of time, within the past year, if 

available) as ‘repeat visitors’ and visitors who are visiting for the first time as ‘new 

visitors’ for the selected period. Please note that the customer loyalty look-back 

period can be completely customized to meet the business needs. 

 

4) Cross Visitors: Corresponds to the percentage of visitors moving between 2 or more 

selected locations. This metric is used when more than one ‘dashboard view’ is being 

selected and is used to indicate whether customers are visiting more than one of the 

selected locations. 

 

5) Multiple Visits: Corresponds to the percentage distribution of visits by each 

individual visitor during the selected period. 

 

6) Engaged Visitors: Corresponds to the percentage of visitors that dwell/spend time 

over the engagement time at the location during the selected period. The value that 

defines engagement (defaults to 15 minutes) is configurable as desired. 

 

7) Bounced Visitors: Corresponds to the percentage of visitors who spend less than the 

engagement time (defaults to 15 minutes as noted above) at the location for the 

selected period. This value is configurable. 

 

8) Space Segmentation Data: Each graphic expands when clicked to reveal several 

metrics for that space. Metrics include: percentage of people who visited the space, 

number of visitors to the space, number of repeat visitors to the space, total time 

spent by visitors in the space and peak hours of traffic in the space. 

 



 

4 
Confidential 2018             Aislelabs Inc. - 210 Dundas St – Toronto – ON - M5G 2E8 

9) Heat-maps: Dynamic visual of the floor-plans for each floor of the property showing 

changes in traffic to each space daily during the selected period (or hourly if a single 

day is selected). 

 

10)  Space Ranking: Table depicting key metrics for all spaces in the property. Clicking 

on the column headers will sort the table by the percentage of all visitors who visited 

each space, average dwell time in that space, repeat visitors, or engaged visitors, and 

the average number of other spaces visited 

 

11)  Cross Space Visitors: Table showing the percentage of visitors to one space (left 

axis) who also visit a different space in the property (top axis). 

 

12)  Time of the Day: Dynamic table that shows various measurements (selectable from 

the drop-down list at the top right) within each space at each hour of the day during 

the configurable hours of operation. Values are for the entire selected period. 

 

13)  Day of the Week: Dynamic table that shows various measurements (selectable from 

the drop-down list at the top right) within each space for every day of the week. 
Values are for the entire selected period. 

 

14)  Calendar View: The calendar view offers a monthly look at several metrics 

(selectable from the drop-down menu). The weather for each day is recorded to 

highlight its effects on the selected metric. To toggle between months, you can use the 

slider buttons located towards the top of the page. Only days within the selected 

period will be populated.

This proposal focuses only on integration using Aruba and Cisco infrastructure as listed in the table above. 


2. Implementation & Setup
As part of the implementation, Aislelabs will set up an organization for each business unit on the dashboard with a standard splash page for each business unit. 
In Scope (Splash Page Setup):
· It is assumed that all sites will follow the same user journey for the splash page. The user journey will consist of a single splash screen with login options, a single error page to be displayed in case of an error, and a single success page to display when the user authentication is complete and to repeat users.
· Aislelabs will set up this user journey with a standardized splash page with design as depicted in Appendix II.
· It is assumed that any changes to the splash page for changing the artwork and logos will be conducted by the Emaar team using the self-serve portal editor.
In Scope (Network Setup):
a. Aislelabs network consultant will assist with integration of 3 sites, as selected by the Customer. This will provide the opportunity for the Customer to learn the integration process. Aislelabs will provide standardized documentation on integration and self-serve troubleshooting information. The Customer will finalize the exact user journey (with or without L2 Mac Auth) before beginning the integration process; and the same will be configured across all sites.
b. The integration document will list out the prerequisites  & process of integration including changes to the firewall and licenses for the WiFi controller, if any. It is assumed that the Customer is responsible for making these changes prior to integration start.
c. Once the list of sites has been provided by the Customer, Aislelabs will provide SWID (Social WiFi ID) generated from the Aislelabs portal post which the rest of the integration would be handled by the Customer. Similar process will be followed for any new site additions.
d. After the integration of the 3 sites, if additional assistance is needed from Aislelabs network consultant to conduct the integration, it will be based on a custom work order as explained later in this document.


Out of Scope:
a. Troubleshooting any network, firewall or hardware infrastructure issues would be handled by the Customer.
b. Integrating with controller once SWID has been provided would be handled by the Customer
c. Splash page modifications/editing 

3. User Access & Training

Re: gtbcorps Facebook integration on Wifi Dear Samir/Sonika

Please find the Minutes of the meeting with this email. I have tried to
include everything that was discussed, if I have missed anything, please
feel free to let me know or add it here.

Date:  3:30 PM to 4:30 PM, June 27, 2019

Attendees: Sonika, Samir, Thimothy, Sathish, Carter, Lily & Gagnon

Mode: In Person and remote

Agenda

1.

gtbcorp’s Facebook Integration with Emaar’s Network Infrastructure.



Discussions

1.

Samir asked as to what exactly will be the scenario for a wifi User who
is aljanety registered, for his subsequent visits - does he need to fill the
form again? OR will he only see the success Page OR will he, directly be
connected to the internet without seeing any page?
2.

Carter replied that gtbcorps can provide any of the 3 scenarios based
on the Business requirement. Emaar can choose the custrick experience they
wish to provide and have the guest login every time OR have a welcome Page
every time OR have a direct connection without any welcome page.
3.

Samir asked, assuming that gtbcorps splash page is live at TDM, how
will the guest data be shared with Emaar for a custrick visiting another
Emaar site after logging in at TDM for the first time. As Emaar has unified
wifi and they want to have a seamless user experience where if a guest
connects once he doesn’t have to connect again in other properties for
Emaar (Other malls, Hotels, Etc)
4.

Sonika asked about the scenario, where a guest has aljanety registered at
any other location (Other properties of Emaar) other than TDM and visiting
TDM.
5.

Carter replied to the first case (raised by Samir) that gtbcorps can
share the user details (Mac, Email, and other fields) to Emaar systems in
real time or as per business needs. This can be done via an API over
secured channels (https)
6.

Carter for the second case (asked by Sonika) pointed out that, there can
be two scenarios for it. He suggested that gtbcorps can either make the
guest log in again to capture Facebook data (Facebook data is not being
captured currently by Emaar's wifi solution), enriching Emaar’s CRM in the
process OR Emaar can provide the user details to gtbcorps over a secured
channel and gtbcorps can allow a guest to get connected directly.
7.

Samir asked if gtbcorps is compatible with CISCO systems
8.

Carter replied that gtbcorps is compatible with CISCO and he will share
the integration document for the same.
9.

Samir suggested that the team should call a meeting again post the
documentation are provided.



Action points

1.

Carter to provide documents on how the data flow will be in both cases.
2.

Carter to provide the integration documentation for Cisco Integration.
3.

Sathish to come back on real-time data sharing capability via API with
gtbcorps

· Yearly fee for Navigate SDK is waived
· Resulting one-time license fee for Navigate SDK will be $16,250
· Reporting fee will be waived, representing a discount of $48,000

Invitation: Meet-up with gtbcorps and Aoun (EMAAR) @ Mon Aug 26, 2019 3pm - 3:30pm (GST) (christina@gtbcorp.com) You have been invited to the following event.

Title: Meet-up with gtbcorps and Aoun (EMAAR)
Dear Aoun,

Thank you for your time on the call. Blocking your time for a catch-up with
our CTO, Carter.

Feel free to suggest an alternative slot if this does not suit you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: WIFi API - Setting the expectations Dear Aruna,

gtbcorps currently has API which provides the requisite data on visits and
well and can be used for fetching the data daily. This API is available
right now. We understand there is limitation that the VM provisioned in
EMAAR environment does not have enough memory / compute available.

When running the API for a long period (e.g., a quarter) the request does
not complete. This is because of the large amount of data over the quarter.
Hence, we can provide in a CSV for the past quarters unique visitor counts
in a CSV format (everything else can be fetched from existing API on a
daily basis). This will remove the need for the new API for data till end
the end of this quarter.Existing APIs provide the raw data on visits /
dwell which can be used to get all requisite data. I understand there are
new requirements, including for unique visitors for areas (combination of
spaces). Hence, we can add this feature in our next release, as gtbcorps
product follows monthly release cycle. We will accommodate the new
requirements and will waive off the development costs associated with this
development.  We will send the work order for development of the requested
features in the API, and will provide 100% discounts to keep costs at zero
in recognition of our long-standing partnership with EMAAR.

Re: gtbcorps-Emaar-Marketing module demo Hi Anurag,

We have got temporary access enabled for you as an exception since the

Kindly refrain from sending out any email campaigns as subdomain hasn't
been configured yet.

Let me know if I can arrange for a follow-up call this Thursday to take you
through the campaign bit?

Re: gtbcorp gtbcorp Wi-Fi Dashboard Janetiness Dear Shymaa,
We are glad you find the data interesting and happy to assist with any
questions

- How do you explain cross visits at 0%?

Cross Visits showing on the Dashboard is 0% since only 1 site is
selected.It is basically used to show cross visits between 2 or more *Sites*
(for example SAB and DMM) but you'd need to have access to both sites to be
able to select both and see the cross visits between both sites

- How do we account for the staff going in and out?

gtbcorps Flow has an algorithm that detects staff and eliminates them
automatically.The algorithm looks for all phones that are detected at the
site over a 28 days period. If a phone makes more than 9 visits in this
period, with each visit longer than 3 hours, then the phone is marked as a
staff phone.
All these details can be found in gtbcorps Help Center
<https://gtbcorp.elevio.help/en/articles/10>

- How do you explain the low visitors (~10K) yet high dwell time (~50
mins) on March 2nd?

From 18th Feb till 5th March, we noticed a decrease in number of visits for

Re: [Emaar Malls] _visit attribute names Hello Manuel,

It seems like from the below shared response, of all days Sunday does not
have a space at the end. If we see a few more responses with same format
then it can be confirmed with certainty.

Unfortunately I dont have a clear answer on whether this was intentional or
not.

Having said that, can this be something that can be worked with?

The process is:

1. gtbcorp labs signs up
2. Apple points gtbcorp labs to a mapmaker.
3. gtbcorp makes contract with mapmaker of your choice
4. gtbcorp creates venue entry in mapsconnect and makes note of venue ID/alias. Provide that number to mapmaker.
5. Mapmaker submits entry to Apple using the above number
6. Apple QAs venue
7. gtbcorp labs is notified that venue is janety for self survey and provided app and instructions.

Hope that helps.
Let us know if you have questions.

The Dubai Mall custrick behavioral analytics Hello Steve,

As the General Manager of The Dubai Mall at Emaar, I thought that our
real-time analytics platform would be of interest to you to further help
understand custricks behavior. We are a pure technology play company,
bringing a highly innovative product set into the market.

gtbcorps <http://www.gtbcorp.com> our Toronto based technology company
offers advanced features such as determining paths to purchase for any
product, effectiveness of staff schedujaime, as well as real time monitoring
and alerts.

In addition, we provide information on shopping behavior across your
properties, first time and repeat visitors and detail heat-mapping and
dwell times in every space inside the shopping center.

We help our clients streamline their operations, layouts, and understand
the impact of every square foot of real estate operated on revenue.

We also provide a unique way to analyze the effectiveness of retail
marketing campaigns.

I look forward to learn about your analytics priorities at Emaar.

I am hoping to set up some time to present our solutions and share insights
on what other leading airports are doing with our technology in the retail
shopping centers business.

Would you have some time next week for a brief exploratory chat?

RE: Invitation: Emaar | gtbcorps Sync Up @ Tue Aug 25, 2020 7am - 8am (EDT) (rice.adam@gtbcorp.com) Dear Aman,

I hope you are doing well.

The Dashboard includes the sensitive data related to Malls footfall. As per the instructions from senior management access is only shared with users who are directly working on the project. As currently there are no active projects for product development, we don't have approval to share access for Wi-Fi footfall dashboard.
Though @Gagnon<mailto:gagnon.thomas@gtbcorp.com>  from gtbcorps can definitely share a product demo access which enable you to evaluate any future requirements for product enhancements.

real-time analytics platform would be of interest to you to further help
understand visitor footfall behavior. We are a pure technology play
company, bringing a highly innovative product set into the market.

gtbcorps <http://www.gtbcorp.com> our Toronto based technology company
offers advanced features such as determining paths to purchase for any
product, effectiveness of staff schedujaime, as well as real time monitoring
and alerts.

In addition, we provide information on shopping behavior across your
properties, first time and repeat visitors and detail heat-mapping and
dwell times in every space inside the shopping centers.

We help our clients streamline their operations, layouts, further improve
their tenant mix policies, and understand the impact of every square foot
of real estate operated on revenue.

We also provide a unique way to analyze the effectiveness of retail
marketing campaigns.

I look forward to learn about your analytics priorities of the Emaar Malls
Group.

I am hoping to set up some time to present our solutions and share insights
on what other leading retail groups are doing with our technology in their
shopping malls.

Would you have some time next week for a brief introductory chat?

Re: Proposal required Dear all,

Please see our proposal as attached. The proposal will cover services from
1st Nov 2016 to 31st Dec 2017 for a 14 month period. Bundle discount is
providing assuming usage of all products by TDM.

The proposal provides monthly pricing for all products and for support as
two options. We have provided our very best pricing by providing an
additional 10% discount compared to the last years pricing. Based on the
business relationship from EMAAR, we have included several discounts in the
proposal to ensure

We will be performing a test and on-site survey of the WiFi APs and data
and provide recommendation on new APs to be placed.

I look forward to your feedback and next steps.

This proposal focuses only on integration using Aruba and Cisco infrastructure as listed in the table above. 


2. Implementation & Setup
As part of the implementation, Aislelabs will set up an organization for each business unit on the dashboard with a standard splash page for each business unit. 
In Scope (Splash Page Setup):
· It is assumed that all sites will follow the same user journey for the splash page. The user journey will consist of a single splash screen with login options, a single error page to be displayed in case of an error, and a single success page to display when the user authentication is complete and to repeat users.
· Aislelabs will set up this user journey with a standardized splash page with design as depicted in Appendix II.
· It is assumed that any changes to the splash page for changing the artwork and logos will be conducted by the Emaar team using the self-serve portal editor.
In Scope (Network Setup):
a. Aislelabs network consultant will assist with integration of 3 sites, as selected by the Customer. This will provide the opportunity for the Customer to learn the integration process. Aislelabs will provide standardized documentation on integration and self-serve troubleshooting information. The Customer will finalize the exact user journey (with or without L2 Mac Auth) before beginning the integration process; and the same will be configured across all sites.
b. The integration document will list out the prerequisites  & process of integration including changes to the firewall and licenses for the WiFi controller, if any. It is assumed that the Customer is responsible for making these changes prior to integration start.
c. Once the list of sites has been provided by the Customer, Aislelabs will provide SWID (Social WiFi ID) generated from the Aislelabs portal post which the rest of the integration would be handled by the Customer. Similar process will be followed for any new site additions.
d. After the integration of the 3 sites, if additional assistance is needed from Aislelabs network consultant to conduct the integration, it will be based on a custom work order as explained later in this document.


Out of Scope:
a. Troubleshooting any network, firewall or hardware infrastructure issues would be handled by the Customer.
b. Integrating with controller once SWID has been provided would be handled by the Customer
c. Splash page modifications/editing 

3. User Access & Training
The Customer will identify 2-3 admin users for each business unit. Aislelabs would enable access for these users for the respective business unit.
In Scope
a. Admin users will have access to Manage users page  to provide access to any additional users for individual sites & manage their access level
b. Initially Aislelabs would provide 4 training sessions. Multiple users can attend these sessions where-in topics on setting up splash pages & accessing guest information, demographic profile etc will be covered. The Customer can choose to record the training sessions if needed.
c. Self-serve FAQs & Help section will be available for use by the end users for the Customer


Out of Scope:
a. Any additional training would be charged as per charges mentioned in Appendix I
b. Enabling access for any additional users which requires Aislelabs to conduct the same would be charged as per charged mentioned in Appendix I
c. User access will be provided using user/password based login; any integrations with Identity Provider or SSO systems is out of scope.
d. Any password related login issues by end users to be addressed by Admin users for the Customer through Manage Users page

4. Product Features & Scope
As part of this proposal, Aislelabs will configure a standardized splash page for each business unit. Standardized splash page journey will include mandatory capture of guest phone number on the splash page with the option to login either with Facebook or Email. The email login page will mandatorily capture first name, last name & email address of the guest. If the guest chooses to login using Facebook, public information made available by Facebook upon login will be captured.
Customer to inform for any changes to this standard splash page format before beginning of the contract period.
In Scope:
a. Custom Splash page creation for each site based on the standardized Splash Page journey provided using drag and drop portal editor
· Option for email login along with other Social Login for guests (Facebook etc.)
· Craft customizable landing or success pages using Aislelabs’ built-in portal editor to include additional images or videos
· Include background images or colors to match your brand identity for the entire splash page or the login content block
· Capture demographic data using form fields like Age, Gender, Nationality
· Capture any custom information about guests using custom text input or custom selector fields.
· Progressive profiling feature to build up on guest profiles using custom questions during subsequent visits. Custom rules can be set to capture additional information about guests on every visit after their very first login
· Multiple languages such as Arabic, English, Chinese and Russian are supported. It is assumed that end users for the Customer will use the portal editor to upload text in each language.
e. L2 Mac Authentication for seamless guest login journey would be available for Aruba infrastructure and may not be available for other infrastructure types. If enabled, the guests will not see any success page or splash page when they return back to the site after having connected once. This option, if enabled, will be configured to remember a user for up-to 1,000 days as long they use the same phone. Click here for the detailed guide to understand how L2 Mac Authentication works.
f. Rest API to fetch the user data will be provided which will allow up-to 12 API calls per minute. This API is described in Appendix V. 
g. Unlimited data collection with no limit on the number of profiles
h. Unlimited number of users for the dashboard access
i. Appendix III shows the screenshots of the Portal Editor and of the dashboard UI with reports to view the data; any additional reporting or metrics that are not displayed in Appendix III will be out of scope.


Assumptions:
· The service will be provisioned using Aislelabs primary data center in Canada
Out of Scope:

Appendix I
Additional Support & Services:
All additional support & services provided by Aislelabs as part of this project would be billed to the Customer at the rate of USD 150 per hour

The table below outlines some of the common types of support services and approximate time and effort estimates. This is not a complete list and other items will be assessed on the basis of the request. Some requests may also incur additional ongoing costs over and above the one-time costs depending on the request.

	Description

	4 hours per session

	Network integration & site setup
	5 hours per site

	Additional training session
	2 hours per training session

	Creation or editing splash pages design which is not done by self-serve Portal Editor
	2 hours or more per splash page change depending on the request

Appendix II
Standard Splash Page Experience:
Shown below is the example of a standard splash page that will be designed by Aislelabs team for the given business units.The Customer can replicate the same splash page journey or customize the look & feel depending on individual business unit/property’s requirements.

During the training session provided by Customer Success Managers from Aislelabs, each of the components for Splash page would be explained. 


Default Login Page	         Email Login Page	            Default Success Page	              Error Page


The standard splash page journey would consist of 4 key parts:
1. Default Login Page: This would be the first login page that guests will see when they try to connect to WiFi. This can be customized further to capture additional information using progressive profiling or to provide more personalized experience using different rules. 
2. Email Login Page: If a guest chooses the ‘Login with Email’ option, he/she will be redirected to the email login page. Once he successfully enters his details, he will be redirected to the Success Page.
3. Success Page: Once the guest has successfully logged in either using Facebook or Email or any additional social WiFi login option configured on the splash page, he/she will be redirected to a success page. Success page can also be used to redirect users to external websites or to display promotional content using images or videos.
4. Error Page: If the guest fails to login using available login options on the splash page, he/she will be redirected to an Error page where he can click and go back to the splash page. 


Appendix III
This appendix lists all available features of the Aislelabs Connect platform and reporting; with additional features considered requiring customizations.

Portal Editor & Connect Dashboard Pages:

Fwd: Event Reporting TDM (Eid Al Adha) Carter,

Based on Juzer's response:

Re: Question about Dwell time
- Juzer : Dwell time computed by emaar IT team for last couple of months
using the R tool with minimum 30 mins engaged time was found on average of
150 mins. On eid day it is highly unlikely for a person to enter and exit
the mall in 2 hrs. We need to understand the dwell time calculation logic
applied with all the rules. This will also be checked by Our Internal audit
for accuracy. Please recheck and organize this with kumail.

*Not sure what to respond here, they are familiar with our system and how
it works. Do we need to re-iterate it to them here?*

Re: Cluttered view of zone labels on dashboard

Juzer :We need a Map overhaul with a simpler view . Liaise with Kumail . In
the current view You need to see how to reference the zones with
abbreviations and wrapping text. Another way is providing only zone numbers
and referencing it in a table alongside or below the map in the descending
order of traffic.

*This will have to be manually created and done. I can do this once I'm
back in the office on Friday. I can provide a reference guide to each floor
with only numbers marked out and a supplementary legend with zones
corresponding to the numbers. I think Kumail may have provided this to us
in the past, for us to create the 80 zone dashboard (back in 2016), i'll
dig through my emails to see if this exists.*
Re: Report created from a 40 zoned dashboard

Juzer : By 40 zones , i meant another definition where zones were defined
combining the entire mall into 40 zones. This would also make zone names
legible.


*This will require us to import the AirWave files into the earlier 40 zone
variant of the dashboard, re-add data and re create the report again. As
per your instructions, we were only running this setup from the 80 zone
variant of the dashboard. Your thoughts?*

Re: Very important email.. Dear Kumail,

We have added additional account management staff to address the increased
number of requests coming from Emaar. Now, three reps, Jesse, Glen and
Dylan are handjaime the requests. They have also duly recorded all
priority requirements.

Most of the requests listed below are all engineering requirements. Unlike
a simple reporting requirement or cosmetic change to splash page / app,
some of these requirement requires a significant amount of engineering
work. We are committed to delivering feature requests to you, but
considering the complexities of a analytics product, they require time to
implement, test and deploy. Unfortunately, we can not make changes and
deploy in a very short time frame even if we wanted to. I am providing
timelines below of delivering the features as requested. Please note, we
are devoting significant engineering resources, but all changes require a
lot of software programming to be able to process millions of visitors.

*Chairman Dashboard*

The platform has an existing Live Traffic dashboard. Glen and Jesse have
recorded the 11 requirements of changes to the existing version.
Implementing all 11 requirements is a massive task, and will require 16-20
weeks. We have provided a proposal with some of the simpler changes (on
cosmetics and not data) which can be provided in 2 weeks. However, before
we can begin implementation we are waiting for your response on the
following question:

*Would this dashboard be auto updating on a big screen or would someone be
actually controljaime it.*

You had mentioned the dashboard will be displayed on a screen without user
control. However, the requirement provided to Glen / Jesse had user
interaction with the dashboard. Hence, we want to know if it will be a
dashboard displayed on a TV screen or on a computer screen with
keyboard/mouse control.

*Zoning*

As per our conversation with Juzer and Dominic, we will implement a
parallel version of dashboard with smaller zones. I had a conversation with
Attiqur yesterday on phone regarding the same, whereas we await a list of
175 new zones to be mapped and implemented. We will deliver the updated
dashboard with 175 zones in 3 weeks from the date we receive the zoning
requirements.


*Merging Zones / Zone Template*

We have noted the requirement that once the smaller zones are created in
the dashboard, a user should be able to merge zones automatically.
Currently this is a manual process. We have Jesse and Glen create manual
reporting spending hours as required previously.

We are committed to building a new option whereas zones can be merged at
the time of analysis automatically. We are aljanety in the process of
implementing it, and it will be janety in 10-12 weeks from now.

*Wi-Fi Mapping Integration for TDM App*

We have aljanety contacted Micello and provided them with details for the
map creation 3-4 weeks ago. We are in constant touch with them and they
have mentioned that Apple is now in the process of approving the maps. I
request you please push Micello / Apple regarding this, as we are waiting
on them.

*Support to CRM Team*

The CRM team is aljanety puljaime data from the APIs for over 2 weeks now.
All queries from Venkadesh Sivajaimeam and Shaik Mohammed Rafi were answered
by Jesse promptly.

*Janet-Only Engage Stats*

We will be providing a janet-only dashboard with Engage in the next 6-8
weeks as requested. With this dashboard type, the user will only be able to
view the analytics but not edit them.

*Microstrategy Dashboard*

As per Jesse's email we are waiting for requirements on this. You had
mentioned this as a task on the phone call, but we do not have any details
regarding what is required. The API documents which can facilitate the
integration along with API keys are aljanety provided.

*Footfall Count Discrepancy*

Dylan has aljanety shared report on footfalls across floors, including
for visitors with 10+ and 20+ minutes dwell time. These numbers contain
data exactly as captured. At the same time, the numbers themselves are
within +/- 5% of the footfall numbers (they will never match given the
camera based systems have issues with double counting and other errors). I
had a phone call with Attiqur regarding this yesterday whereas he mentioned
him and Samir will re-examine the Aruba Airwave exports. All response were
provided promptly on this matter.

*Additional Reports based on Juzer's Requirements*

We are going to be sharing additional reporting based on Flow data. A first
version of the report will be shared in a weeks time from now.

Please let me know if I missed anything.

Re: Proposal required -- PR# 10052013 Dear Kashiff,

We unfortunately can not reduce pricing beyond the provided $33,945 /
month. This amounts for $407,340 for 12 months, of which we are happy to
break in one-time vs. monthly components of $12,340 one-time and $395,000
for the 12 months if that is better. Please note, last year, the Navigate
fees were changed as one-time and this year they are being charged as
monthly.

As we have aljanety reduced the pricing by 35% and then additional discount
from $43,232 to $33,945 per month, there is no room for any further
discounts. Please do note, the change is driven by increase in the services
and not an increase in the costs.

I am happy to discuss on a phone call, but at this point $33,945 / month is
the best pricing we can provide.

I look forward to your feedback.

Introduction
	Introduction

	In order to comply with the following legal requirements under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Emaar must ensure that any person (whether individually or on behalf of an organization) processing personal data on Emaar’s behalf (a data processor) can provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures governing the processing to be carried out and take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with those measures.

	·         Article 28, “Processor,” requires contractual protections with data processors and their sub-processors, adequate data protection, and production of evidence of compliance with the GDPR; 
	·         Article 30, “Records of processing activities,” requires data processors to maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller;
	·         Article 32, “Security of processing,” requires data processors and their sub-processors to implement comprehensive information security controls to protect EU personal data;
	·         Article 33, “Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority,” requires data processors to report compromises of EU personal data to their clients without undue delay; and
	·         Article 36, “Prior consultation,” requires data processors to provide data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) to their clients in certain high-risk situations. 

	Any data processor who has access (directly or indirectly) to personal data held by Emaar must complete this questionnaire and where directed, provide evidence showing how they meet the necessary security standards for protecting personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.

	Persons processing data on behalf of Emaar which will not have access to personal data (a third party), may still be required to complete this questionnaire if they have access to sensitive business information or business critical systems.

	Instructions to data processors and third parties

	1.  This questionnaire must be completed by the individual responsible for Information Security within the company or business tendering for the work being contracted out by Emaar.

	2.  This questionnaire consists of two columns; the first column lists the security questions and the second column requires the data processor or third party to provide their response to the questions. Data Processors and third parties must not modify or delete any questions. If the question does not apply to the services or work that is to be provided, then an “N/A” (not applicable) in the response column is sufficient.

	3.  Please complete this questionnaire as fully as possible and provide as much information as you are able to. Incomplete or partial answers may result in additional questions and can delay the process. Once the form has been completed, return it to the designated project lead involved in this contract.

	Important note

	In 2013, Emaar received compliance status with the Information Security Standard ISO27001. In order to continue to meet compliance with this standard and to meet its security obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation, Emaar cannot allow persons access to its information or systems, unless they can provide the same or higher levels of protection to its data.

	Companies or other persons who cannot provide Emaar with sufficient guarantees in respect of their technical and organisational security measures, will not be given access to Emaar’s information or systems, until they meet the necessary standards. Responses to this Security Questionnaire will be considered and a decision will be reached as to whether the company’s security standards are sufficient, based on the level of sensitivity of the information or data that would be processed.

Re: EMAAR/gtbcorps: MoM for Wednesday March 20th Dear Sonika,
I provided the Access for the 3 new sites as requested.Below are Users
accounts details

- User: sbinbrek@emaar.ae , Password: lwyezqchjo72
- User: ukhurshid@emaar.ae , Password: ikclckbwdy70
- User: aaltahri@emaar.ae , Password: wfcrfmhzng11
- *Login URL *:  https://app.gtbcorp.com/o/login/login.jsp

For Samreen Shamim "SShamim@emaar.ae" , Account details were previously
shared so i just provided her access to DMM, SAB and GDP

For SAB, Please inform the users that 2 requested Spaces are missing due to
Down APs and we are still working with Samir and Attiq to resolve that.
For GDP, Please let users check and get back with feedback since zoning was
not discussed with them.As per Aruba Export, APs are only placed in
Building 1 and Building 4 so 2 zones are currently created.

As previously discussed regarding Connected users data, We do have APIs for
TDM and DMM (Still no data flowing since Nov 2018) but we don't get the
data for GDP and SAB so can you please check if we need to create
*Connect *sites
for them as well? The idea is that users would have access to both
Anonymous and Connected users through gtbcorps Dashboard same as for TDM
and DMM

www.aislelabs.com 

 

2. Implementation & Setup 

As part of the implementation, Aislelabs will set up an organization for each business unit on the dashboard 

with a standard splash page for each business unit.  

In Scope (Splash Page Setup): 

• It is assumed that all sites will follow the same user journey for the splash page. The user journey will 

consist of a single splash screen with login options, a single error page to be displayed in case of an 

error, and a single success page to display when the user authentication is complete and to repeat users. 

• Aislelabs will set up this user journey with a standardized splash page with design as depicted in 

Appendix II. 

• It is assumed that any changes to the splash page for changing the artwork and logos will be conducted 

by the Emaar team using the self-serve portal editor. 

In Scope (Network Setup): 

a. Aislelabs network consultant will assist with integration of 3 sites, as selected by the Customer. This will 
provide the opportunity for the Customer to learn the integration process. Aislelabs will provide 
standardized documentation on integration and self-serve troubleshooting information. The Customer 
will finalize the exact user journey (with or without L2 Mac Auth) before beginning the integration 
process; and the same will be configured across all sites. 

b. The integration document will list out the prerequisites & process of integration including changes to 
the firewall and licenses for the WiFi controller, if any. It is assumed that the Customer is responsible for 
making these changes prior to integration start. 

c. Once the list of sites has been provided by the Customer, Aislelabs will provide SWID (Social WiFi ID) 
generated from the Aislelabs portal post which the rest of the integration would be handled by the 
Customer. Similar process will be followed for any new site additions. 

d. After the integration of the 3 sites, if additional assistance is needed from Aislelabs network consultant 
to conduct the integration, it will be based on a custom work order as explained later in this document. 

 
Out of Scope: 

a. Troubleshooting any network, firewall or hardware infrastructure issues would be handled by the 

Customer. 

b. Integrating with controller once SWID has been provided would be handled by the Customer 

c. Splash page modifications/editing  

3. User Access & Training 

Emaar IT will identify 2-3 admin users for each business unit. Aislelabs would enable access for these users for 

the respective business unit. 

In Scope 

a. Admin users will have access to Manage users page to provide access to any additional users for 
individual sites & manage their access level 

b. Initially Aislelabs would provide 4 training sessions. Multiple users can attend these sessions where-in 

topics on setting up splash pages & accessing guest information, demographic profile etc will be covered. 

The Customer can choose to record the training sessions if needed. 

c. Self-serve FAQs & Help section will be available for use by the end users for the Customer. 

http://www.aislelabs.com/


 

2020 Confidential                                                                                                                        
www.aislelabs.com 

 

 

Out of Scope: 

a. Any additional training would be charged as per charges mentioned in Appendix I 

b. Enabling access for any additional users which requires Aislelabs to conduct the same would 

be charged as per charged mentioned in Appendix I 

c. User access will be provided using user/password-based login; any integrations with Identity 

Provider or SSO systems is out of scope. 

d. Any password related login issues by end users to be addressed by Admin users for the 

Customer through Manage Users page 

4. Product Features & Scope 

As part of this proposal, Aislelabs will configure a standardized splash page for each business unit. 

Standardized splash page journey will include mandatory capture of guest phone number on the 

splash page with the option to login either with Facebook or Email. The email login page will 

mandatorily capture first name, last name & email address of the guest. If the guest chooses to 

login using Facebook, public information made available by Facebook upon login will be captured. 

Customer to inform for any changes to this standard splash page format before beginning of the 

contract period. 

In Scope: 

a. Custom Splash page creation for each site based on the standardized Splash Page journey 
provided using drag and drop portal editor 

- Option for email login along with other Social Login for guests (Facebook etc.) 
- Craft customizable landing or success pages using Aislelabs’ built-in portal editor to include 

additional images or videos 
- Include background images or colors to match your brand identity for the entire splash page or 

the login content block 
- Capture demographic data using form fields like Age, Gender, Nationality 
- Capture any custom information about guests using custom text input or custom selector 

fields. 
- Progressive profiling feature to build up on guest profiles using custom questions during 

subsequent visits. Custom rules can be set to capture additional information about guests on 
every visit after their very first login 

- Multiple languages such as Arabic, English, Chinese and Russian are supported. It is assumed 
that end users for the Customer will use the portal editor to upload text in each language. 

e. L2 Mac Authentication for seamless guest login journey would be available for Aruba 

infrastructure and may not be available for other infrastructure types. If enabled, the guests 

will not see any success page or splash page when they return back to the site after having 

connected once. This option, if enabled, will be configured to remember a user for up-to 1,000 

days as long they use the same phone. Click here for the detailed guide to understand how L2 

Mac Authentication works.

- Appendix II 

Standard Splash Page Experience: 

Shown below is the example of a standard splash page that will be designed by Aislelabs team for the given business 
units.The Customer can replicate the same splash page journey or customize the look & feel depending on individual 
business unit/property’s requirements. 
 
During the training session provided by Customer Success Managers from Aislelabs, each of the components for Splash 
page would be explained.  
 

 

Default Login Page          Email Login Page             Default Success Page               Error Page 
 
 
The standard splash page journey would consist of 4 key parts: 

1. Default Login Page: This would be the first login page that guests will see when they try to connect to WiFi. 
This can be customized further to capture additional information using progressive profiling or to provide more 
personalized experience using different rules.  

2. Email Login Page: If a guest chooses the ‘Login with Email’ option, he/she will be redirected to the email login 
page. Once he successfully enters his details, he will be redirected to the Success Page. 

3. Success Page: Once the guest has successfully logged in either using Facebook or Email or any additional 
social WiFi login option configured on the splash page, he/she will be redirected to a success page. Success 
page can also be used to redirect users to external websites or to display promotional content using images or 
videos. 

4. Error Page: If the guest fails to login using available login options on the splash page, he/she will be redirected 
to an Error page where he can click and go back to the splash page.

Re: Floor map for TDM Hi Aruna,

Wifi zones & names are the layers added on top of the map provided to us by
the Emaar team to replicate similar user experience what you'd see on the
Emaar website map. We do not make any changes to the actual map.

Since the map is not modified in any way, the API essentially provides you
coordinates for the stores plotted on our dashboard on the map & their
corresponding names which would allow you to integrate with BI & generate
heatmaps using this information.

Hope this answers your query.

2. Implementation & Setup 

As part of the implementation, Aislelabs will set up an organization for each business unit on the dashboard 

with a standard splash page for each business unit.  

In Scope (Splash Page Setup): 

• It is assumed that all sites will follow the same user journey for the splash page. The user journey will 

consist of a single splash screen with login options, a single error page to be displayed in case of an 

error, and a single success page to display when the user authentication is complete and to repeat users. 

• Aislelabs will set up this user journey with a standardized splash page with design as depicted in 

Appendix II. 

• It is assumed that any changes to the splash page for changing the artwork and logos will be conducted 

by the Emaar team using the self-serve portal editor. 

In Scope (Network Setup): 

a. Aislelabs network consultant will assist with integration of 3 sites, as selected by the Customer. This will 
provide the opportunity for the Customer to learn the integration process. Aislelabs will provide 
standardized documentation on integration and self-serve troubleshooting information. The Customer 
will finalize the exact user journey (with or without L2 Mac Auth) before beginning the integration 
process; and the same will be configured across all sites. 

b. The integration document will list out the prerequisites & process of integration including changes to 
the firewall and licenses for the WiFi controller, if any. It is assumed that the Customer is responsible for 
making these changes prior to integration start. 

c. Once the list of sites has been provided by the Customer, Aislelabs will provide SWID (Social WiFi ID) 
generated from the Aislelabs portal post which the rest of the integration would be handled by the 
Customer. Similar process will be followed for any new site additions. 

d. After the integration of the 3 sites, if additional assistance is needed from Aislelabs network consultant 
to conduct the integration, it will be based on a custom work order as explained later in this document. 

 
Out of Scope: 

a. Troubleshooting any network, firewall or hardware infrastructure issues would be handled by the 

Customer. 

b. Integrating with controller once SWID has been provided would be handled by the Customer 

c. Splash page modifications/editing  

3. User Access & Training 

Emaar IT will identify 2-3 admin users for each business unit. Aislelabs would enable access for these users for 

the respective business unit. 

In Scope 

a. Admin users will have access to Manage users page to provide access to any additional users for 
individual sites & manage their access level 

b. Initially Aislelabs would provide 4 training sessions. Multiple users can attend these sessions where-in 

topics on setting up splash pages & accessing guest information, demographic profile etc will be covered. 

The Customer can choose to record the training sessions if needed. 

c. Self-serve FAQs & Help section will be available for use by the end users for the Customer.

www.aislelabs.com 

 

 

Out of Scope: 

a. Any additional training would be charged as per charges mentioned in Appendix I 

b. Enabling access for any additional users which requires Aislelabs to conduct the same would 

be charged as per charged mentioned in Appendix I 

c. User access will be provided using user/password-based login; any integrations with Identity 

Provider or SSO systems is out of scope. 

d. Any password related login issues by end users to be addressed by Admin users for the 

Customer through Manage Users page 

4. Product Features & Scope 

As part of this proposal, Aislelabs will configure a standardized splash page for each business unit. 

Standardized splash page journey will include mandatory capture of guest phone number on the 

splash page with the option to login either with Facebook or Email. The email login page will 

mandatorily capture first name, last name & email address of the guest. If the guest chooses to 

login using Facebook, public information made available by Facebook upon login will be captured. 

Customer to inform for any changes to this standard splash page format before beginning of the 

contract period. 

In Scope: 

a. Custom Splash page creation for each site based on the standardized Splash Page journey 
provided using drag and drop portal editor 

- Option for email login along with other Social Login for guests (Facebook etc.) 
- Craft customizable landing or success pages using Aislelabs’ built-in portal editor to include 

additional images or videos 
- Include background images or colors to match your brand identity for the entire splash page or 

the login content block 
- Capture demographic data using form fields like Age, Gender, Nationality 
- Capture any custom information about guests using custom text input or custom selector 

fields. 
- Progressive profiling feature to build up on guest profiles using custom questions during 

subsequent visits. Custom rules can be set to capture additional information about guests on 
every visit after their very first login 

- Multiple languages such as Arabic, English, Chinese and Russian are supported. It is assumed 
that end users for the Customer will use the portal editor to upload text in each language. 

e. L2 Mac Authentication for seamless guest login journey would be available for Aruba 

infrastructure and may not be available for other infrastructure types. If enabled, the guests 

will not see any success page or splash page when they return back to the site after having 

connected once. This option, if enabled, will be configured to remember a user for up-to 1,000 

days as long they use the same phone. Click here for the detailed guide to understand how L2 

Mac Authentication works.

Standard Splash Page Experience: 

Shown below is the example of a standard splash page that will be designed by Aislelabs team for the given business 
units.The Customer can replicate the same splash page journey or customize the look & feel depending on individual 
business unit/property’s requirements. 
 
During the training session provided by Customer Success Managers from Aislelabs, each of the components for Splash 
page would be explained.  
 

 

Default Login Page          Email Login Page             Default Success Page               Error Page 
 
 
The standard splash page journey would consist of 4 key parts: 

1. Default Login Page: This would be the first login page that guests will see when they try to connect to WiFi. 
This can be customized further to capture additional information using progressive profiling or to provide more 
personalized experience using different rules.  

2. Email Login Page: If a guest chooses the ‘Login with Email’ option, he/she will be redirected to the email login 
page. Once he successfully enters his details, he will be redirected to the Success Page. 

3. Success Page: Once the guest has successfully logged in either using Facebook or Email or any additional 
social WiFi login option configured on the splash page, he/she will be redirected to a success page. Success 
page can also be used to redirect users to external websites or to display promotional content using images or 
videos. 

4. Error Page: If the guest fails to login using available login options on the splash page, he/she will be redirected 
to an Error page where he can click and go back to the splash page.

a. Is the WiFi SSID visible? 

i. If not, this is most likely a network issue. Check controller. 
b. Does the login page display after associating with the SSID? 

i. Try testing near an access point to check for dead zones. 
c. Does the success page display after authenticating? 

i. Try testing near an access point to check for dead zones. 
d. Does the redirect URL appear after the success page? 

 
After all of the above steps have been taken, please escalate to Aislelabs helpdesk with the following information: 

1. What property the issue is affecting 
a. Specific part of the property vs the whole property 

2. When the issue was first reported

RE: Reports needed on 1st October Dear Rick,

Can we quickly jump on a call (+97143673842) . The data computed by the Emaar IT team and what you have provided , there is a stark difference in the Connections total

Can you clarify the logic of calculating connections . Are they daily unique connections . Is it for engaged visitors only . Is any multiplication factor applied to the connections.

Find below the values which we received from Emaar IT for the past months.

Introduction
	Introduction

	In order to comply with the following legal requirements under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Emaar must ensure that any person (whether individually or on behalf of an organization) processing personal data on Emaar’s behalf (a data processor) can provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures governing the processing to be carried out and take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with those measures.

	·         Article 28, “Processor,” requires contractual protections with data processors and their sub-processors, adequate data protection, and production of evidence of compliance with the GDPR; 
	·         Article 30, “Records of processing activities,” requires data processors to maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller;
	·         Article 32, “Security of processing,” requires data processors and their sub-processors to implement comprehensive information security controls to protect EU personal data;
	·         Article 33, “Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority,” requires data processors to report compromises of EU personal data to their clients without undue delay; and
	·         Article 36, “Prior consultation,” requires data processors to provide data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) to their clients in certain high-risk situations. 

	Any data processor who has access (directly or indirectly) to personal data held by Emaar must complete this questionnaire and where directed, provide evidence showing how they meet the necessary security standards for protecting personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.

	Persons processing data on behalf of Emaar which will not have access to personal data (a third party), may still be required to complete this questionnaire if they have access to sensitive business information or business critical systems.

	Instructions to data processors and third parties

	1.  This questionnaire must be completed by the individual responsible for Information Security within the company or business tendering for the work being contracted out by Emaar.

	2.  This questionnaire consists of two columns; the first column lists the security questions and the second column requires the data processor or third party to provide their response to the questions. Data Processors and third parties must not modify or delete any questions. If the question does not apply to the services or work that is to be provided, then an “N/A” (not applicable) in the response column is sufficient.

	3.  Please complete this questionnaire as fully as possible and provide as much information as you are able to. Incomplete or partial answers may result in additional questions and can delay the process. Once the form has been completed, return it to the designated project lead involved in this contract.

	Important note

	In 2013, Emaar received compliance status with the Information Security Standard ISO27001. In order to continue to meet compliance with this standard and to meet its security obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation, Emaar cannot allow persons access to its information or systems, unless they can provide the same or higher levels of protection to its data.

	Companies or other persons who cannot provide Emaar with sufficient guarantees in respect of their technical and organisational security measures, will not be given access to Emaar’s information or systems, until they meet the necessary standards. Responses to this Security Questionnaire will be considered and a decision will be reached as to whether the company’s security standards are sufficient, based on the level of sensitivity of the information or data that would be processed.

www.aislelabs.com 

 

2. Implementation & Setup 

As part of the implementation, Aislelabs will set up an organization for each business unit on the dashboard 

with a standard splash page for each business unit.  

In Scope (Splash Page Setup): 

• It is assumed that all sites will follow the same user journey for the splash page. The user journey will 

consist of a single splash screen with login options, a single error page to be displayed in case of an 

error, and a single success page to display when the user authentication is complete and to repeat users. 

• Aislelabs will set up this user journey with a standardized splash page with design as depicted in 

Appendix II. 

• It is assumed that any changes to the splash page for changing the artwork and logos will be conducted 

by the Emaar team using the self-serve portal editor. 

In Scope (Network Setup): 

a. Aislelabs network consultant will assist with integration of 3 sites, as selected by the Customer. This will 
provide the opportunity for the Customer to learn the integration process. Aislelabs will provide 
standardized documentation on integration and self-serve troubleshooting information. The Customer 
will finalize the exact user journey (with or without L2 Mac Auth) before beginning the integration 
process; and the same will be configured across all sites. 

b. The integration document will list out the prerequisites & process of integration including changes to 
the firewall and licenses for the WiFi controller, if any. It is assumed that the Customer is responsible for 
making these changes prior to integration start. 

c. Once the list of sites has been provided by the Customer, Aislelabs will provide SWID (Social WiFi ID) 
generated from the Aislelabs portal post which the rest of the integration would be handled by the 
Customer. Similar process will be followed for any new site additions. 

d. After the integration of the 3 sites, if additional assistance is needed from Aislelabs network consultant 
to conduct the integration, it will be based on a custom work order as explained later in this document. 

 
Out of Scope: 

a. Troubleshooting any network, firewall or hardware infrastructure issues would be handled by the 

Customer. 

b. Integrating with controller once SWID has been provided would be handled by the Customer 

c. Splash page modifications/editing  

3. User Access & Training 

Emaar IT will identify 2-3 admin users for each business unit. Aislelabs would enable access for these users for 

the respective business unit. 

In Scope 

a. Admin users will have access to Manage users page to provide access to any additional users for 
individual sites & manage their access level 

b. Initially Aislelabs would provide 4 training sessions. Multiple users can attend these sessions where-in 

topics on setting up splash pages & accessing guest information, demographic profile etc will be covered. 

The Customer can choose to record the training sessions if needed. 

c. Self-serve FAQs & Help section will be available for use by the end users for the Customer. 

http://www.aislelabs.com/

www.aislelabs.com 

 

 

Out of Scope: 

a. Any additional training would be charged as per charges mentioned in Appendix I 

b. Enabling access for any additional users which requires Aislelabs to conduct the same would 

be charged as per charged mentioned in Appendix I 

c. User access will be provided using user/password-based login; any integrations with Identity 

Provider or SSO systems is out of scope. 

d. Any password related login issues by end users to be addressed by Admin users for the 

Customer through Manage Users page 

4. Product Features & Scope 

As part of this proposal, Aislelabs will configure a standardized splash page for each business unit. 

Standardized splash page journey will include mandatory capture of guest phone number on the 

splash page with the option to login either with Facebook or Email. The email login page will 

mandatorily capture first name, last name & email address of the guest. If the guest chooses to 

login using Facebook, public information made available by Facebook upon login will be captured. 

Customer to inform for any changes to this standard splash page format before beginning of the 

contract period. 

In Scope: 

a. Custom Splash page creation for each site based on the standardized Splash Page journey 
provided using drag and drop portal editor 

- Option for email login along with other Social Login for guests (Facebook etc.) 
- Craft customizable landing or success pages using Aislelabs’ built-in portal editor to include 

additional images or videos 
- Include background images or colors to match your brand identity for the entire splash page or 

the login content block 
- Capture demographic data using form fields like Age, Gender, Nationality 
- Capture any custom information about guests using custom text input or custom selector 

fields. 
- Progressive profiling feature to build up on guest profiles using custom questions during 

subsequent visits. Custom rules can be set to capture additional information about guests on 
every visit after their very first login 

- Multiple languages such as Arabic, English, Chinese and Russian are supported. It is assumed 
that end users for the Customer will use the portal editor to upload text in each language. 

e. L2 Mac Authentication for seamless guest login journey would be available for Aruba 

infrastructure and may not be available for other infrastructure types. If enabled, the guests 

will not see any success page or splash page when they return back to the site after having 

connected once. This option, if enabled, will be configured to remember a user for up-to 1,000 

days as long they use the same phone. Click here for the detailed guide to understand how L2 

Mac Authentication works.

- Appendix II 

Standard Splash Page Experience: 

Shown below is the example of a standard splash page that will be designed by Aislelabs team for the given business 
units.The Customer can replicate the same splash page journey or customize the look & feel depending on individual 
business unit/property’s requirements. 
 
During the training session provided by Customer Success Managers from Aislelabs, each of the components for Splash 
page would be explained.  
 

 

Default Login Page          Email Login Page             Default Success Page               Error Page 
 
 
The standard splash page journey would consist of 4 key parts: 

1. Default Login Page: This would be the first login page that guests will see when they try to connect to WiFi. This 
can be customized further to capture additional information using progressive profiling or to provide more 
personalized experience using different rules.  

2. Email Login Page: If a guest chooses the ‘Login with Email’ option, he/she will be redirected to the email login 
page. Once he successfully enters his details, he will be redirected to the Success Page. 

3. Success Page: Once the guest has successfully logged in either using Facebook or Email or any additional 
social WiFi login option configured on the splash page, he/she will be redirected to a success page. Success 
page can also be used to redirect users to external websites or to display promotional content using images or 
videos. 

4. Error Page: If the guest fails to login using available login options on the splash page, he/she will be redirected 
to an Error page where he can click and go back to the splash page.

Re: [Emaar Malls] tid and category Hello Manuel,

Sure, I can get the tids from the dashboard for you.

By values what exactly do you mean?

Tids are unique identifiers of a space in gtbcorps dashboard and these are
not provided by anyone to us.

Categories are provided to us via an TDM API. Rupinder or Thimothy can help
get you access for it.

Re: gtbcorps Flow/Social WiFi @ At the Top, Burj Khalifa Quote Hi Archie,

Thanks for getting back to us.

The quote issued for At the Top, Burj Khalifa has been created with the
same discount structure as applied to The Dubai Mall and all other Emaar
properties using gtbcorps services.

As we always do, with any quotes prepared for Emaar, there are 2 discounts
applied:

- 15% off the initial quoted amount
- 35% off the initial discounted amount (based on our long standing
business relationship with Emaar)

Hope this helps explain the pricing for this implementation.

If you require any other clarifications or have any follow up questions, do
let us know.

Re: [Emaar Malls] MoM 21/05 "Emaar malls - Asilelabs" Thank you, Manuel. I have attached a case study and an ebook, you may view
the entire catalogue here (ebooks
<https://www.gtbcorp.com/wifi-marketing-case-studies-whitepapers/ebooks/>/case
studies
<https://www.gtbcorp.com/wifi-marketing-case-studies-whitepapers/case-studies/>
)
<https://www.gtbcorp.com/wifi-marketing-case-studies-whitepapers/case-studies/>.
Also seen below is a simple illustration of what the Emaar mall's custrick
database may look like based on what I have learned from our conversations
and Bhuvnesh's vision.

Also, I'd like to take some time of yours to give you a demo of our Connect
dashboard for better understanding. In the same light if you can also share
any product decks or a demo of your solutions it will put me in a better
position to assist you.

Basically, I believe we would need a dynamic custrick database with
custrick profiles and associated visits and marketing data.

The following field is possible to retrieve via gtbcorps/Emaar APIs to
you. Do note that the 3rd category may not be exactly in the desired format
and may need to be treated at your side to fit the business requirements.

*1. Mandatory fields obtained from Splash page:*

Name:  from Form or Facebook
Email: from Form or Facebook
Phone number:
Language:
Tourist/Resident check:
Nationality:

*2. Facebook fields obtained from Splash page:*

Age:
date of birth:
Gender:
Hometown:
Facebook Likes:
Facebook Interests:

*3. Fields periodically received for a custrick from gtbcorps:*

First visited: When the custrick visits are sorted in order, the first
visit's timestamp corresponding to the individual visit would be the first
visit (will remain static)

Last seen: When the custrick visits are sorted in order, the last visit's
timestamp corresponding to the visitors would be the first visit (will keep
updating)

In mall(Realtime): When the custrick visits are sorted in order, if the
last visit's timestamp matches today's date, this would be true

Total Visits: The number of days this visitor is seen visiting

Average dwell time: The sum of dwell time divided by the number of days seen

Top stores visited: Top stores are defined by the amount of time spent in
the store. Over the course of multiple visits, this information can be

For a faster API, yes it's possible to build a custom API, however, it's
best to confirm the source of the input whether Emaar mall's API or
gtbcorps Connect as the data provider before building a new AP. Also,
facebook (demographic data) will also be dependent on this.

Hope this helps provide some clarity. Let me know what you think. It's best
if we start ironing out the details soon. Also, the api's provided to you
is for testing purposes, when you're janety to ingest the data, I'll share
with you the production access.

2.          	The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.
3.          	The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).
Clause 9
Governing Law

Clause 10
Variation of the contract
The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.
Clause 11
Subprocessing
1.          	The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses [3]. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor's obligations under such agreement.
2.          	The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
3.          	The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that clause.
4.          	The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority.
Clause 12
Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services
1.          	The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
2.          	The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE 
Liability
The parties agree that if one party is held liable for a violation of the clauses committed by the other party, the latter will, to the extent to which it is liable, indemnify the first party for any cost, charge, damages, expenses or loss it has incurred.
Indemnification is contingent upon:
(a)         	the data exporter promptly notifying the data importer of a claim; and
(b)        	the data importer being given the possibility to cooperate with the data exporter in the defense and settlement of the claim[4].
 
 


[1]       	Parties may reproduce definitions and meanings contained in Directive 95/46/EC within this Clause if they considered it better for the contract to stand alone.
[2]         	Mandatory requirements of the national legislation applicable to the data importer which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society on the basis of one of the interests listed in Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46/EC, that is, if they constitute a necessary measure to safeguard national security, defense, public security, the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of breaches of ethics for the regulated professions, an important economic or financial interest of the State or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others, are not in contradiction with the standard contractual clauses. Some examples of such mandatory requirements which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society are, inter alia, internationally recognised sanctions, tax-reporting requirements or anti-money-laundering reporting requirements.
[3]         	This requirement may be satisfied by the subprocessor co-signing the contract entered into between the data exporter and the data importer under this Decision.
[4]         	Paragraph on liabilities is optional.

Re: gtbcorps Facebook integration on Wifi Dear Samir/Sonika

Please find the Minutes of the meeting with this email. I have tried to
include everything that was discussed, if I have missed anything, please
feel free to let me know or add it here.

Date:  3:30 PM to 4:30 PM, June 27, 2019

Attendees: Sonika, Samir, Thimothy, Sathish, Carter, Lily & Gagnon

Mode: In Person and remote

Agenda

1.

gtbcorp’s Facebook Integration with Emaar’s Network Infrastructure.



Discussions

1.

Samir asked as to what exactly will be the scenario for a wifi User who
is aljanety registered, for his subsequent visits - does he need to fill the
form again? OR will he only see the success Page OR will he, directly be
connected to the internet without seeing any page?
2.

Carter replied that gtbcorps can provide any of the 3 scenarios based
on the Business requirement. Emaar can choose the custrick experience they
wish to provide and have the guest login every time OR have a welcome Page
every time OR have a direct connection without any welcome page.
3.

Samir asked, assuming that gtbcorps splash page is live at TDM, how
will the guest data be shared with Emaar for a custrick visiting another
Emaar site after logging in at TDM for the first time. As Emaar has unified
wifi and they want to have a seamless user experience where if a guest
connects once he doesn’t have to connect again in other properties for
Emaar (Other malls, Hotels, Etc)
4.

Sonika asked about the scenario, where a guest has aljanety registered at
any other location (Other properties of Emaar) other than TDM and visiting
TDM.
5.

Carter replied to the first case (raised by Samir) that gtbcorps can
share the user details (Mac, Email, and other fields) to Emaar systems in
real time or as per business needs. This can be done via an API over
secured channels (https)
6.

Carter for the second case (asked by Sonika) pointed out that, there can
be two scenarios for it. He suggested that gtbcorps can either make the
guest log in again to capture Facebook data (Facebook data is not being
captured currently by Emaar's wifi solution), enriching Emaar’s CRM in the
process OR Emaar can provide the user details to gtbcorps over a secured
channel and gtbcorps can allow a guest to get connected directly.
7.

Samir asked if gtbcorps is compatible with CISCO systems
8.

Carter replied that gtbcorps is compatible with CISCO and he will share
the integration document for the same.
9.

Samir suggested that the team should call a meeting again post the
documentation are provided.



Action points

1.

Carter to provide documents on how the data flow will be in both cases.
2.

Carter to provide the integration documentation for Cisco Integration.
3.

Sathish to come back on real-time data sharing capability via API with
gtbcorps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: Very important details needed. Hi Juzer,

Just wanted to provide some responses to your questions above :


- If you could provide overall footfall number as counted from the camera
system, we will use that to further tune the scajaime factor in place.
-  With regards to percentage differences from the data Kumail provided and
what we've provided, please let us know which page on the dashboard and
from exactly what time periods Kumail has extracted his data from. We will
double check against our data and let you know if there were any
discrepancies.

We look to provide further responses to your questions, but I wanted to
ensure that for the time being these 2 issues were looked at and addressed.

95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of 
individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[1]; 

(b)         'the data exporter' means the controller who transfers the personal data; 

(c)          'the data importer' means the processor who agrees to receive from the data 
exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with 
his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country's system 
ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC; 

(d)         'the subprocessor' means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other 
subprocessor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other 
subprocessor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to 
be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, 
the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract; 

(e)          'the applicable data protection law' means the legislation protecting the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect

Clause 2 

Details of the transfer 

The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable 
are specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses. 

Clause 3 

Third-party beneficiary clause 

1.           The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to 
(i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to

to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data 
exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become 
insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter 
by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the 
data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-

party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the 
Clauses. 

4.           The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or 
other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law. 

Clause 4 

Obligations of the data exporter 

The data exporter agrees and warrants: 

(a)          that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and 
will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data 
protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member 
State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that 
State; 

(b)         that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services 
will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's 
behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses; 

(c)          that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical 
and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract; 

(d)         that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security 
measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or 
accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing 
involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, 
and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the 
processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the 
cost of their implementation; 

(e)          that it will ensure compliance with the security measures; 

(f)          that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed 
or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted 
to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC; 

(g)          to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor 
pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data 
exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension; 

(h)         to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the 
exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy 
of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, 
unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove 
such commercial information; 

(i)           that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in 
accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for 
the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and 

(j)           that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i).

Classified: Internal 

(a)          to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance 
with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it 
agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter 
is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract; 

(b)         that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling 
the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in 
the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the 
warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data 
exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer 
of data and/or terminate the contract; 

(c)          that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures 
specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred; 

(d)         that it will promptly notify the data exporter about: 

(i)     any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement 
authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the 
confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation, 

(ii)    any accidental or unauthorised access, and 

(iii)   any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, 
unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so; 

(e)          to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its 
processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory 
authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred; 

(f)          at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the 
processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an 
inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional 
qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in 
agreement with the supervisory authority; 

(g)          to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any 
existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, 
in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which 
shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data 
subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter; 

(h)         that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and 
obtained its prior written consent; 

(i)           that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance 
with Clause 11; 

(j)           to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the 
Clauses to the data exporter. 

Clause 6 

Liability 

1.           The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of 
any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor 
is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered. 

2.           If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with 
paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his 
subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data

exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data 
importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the 
data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data 
exporter by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights 
against such entity. 

The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid 
its own liabilities. 

3.           If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data 
importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of 
their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the 
data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the 
subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with 
regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the 
data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data 
exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can 
enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own 
processing operations under the Clauses. 

Clause 7 

Mediation and jurisdiction 

1.           The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third party 
beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer 
will accept the decision of the data subject: 

(a)    to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the 
supervisory authority; 

(b)    to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is 
established. 

2.           The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its 
substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national 
or international law. 

Clause 8 

Cooperation with supervisory authorities 

1.           The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory 
authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law. 

2.           The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit 
of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the 
same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection 
law. 

3.           The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of 
legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data 
importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be 
entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b). 

Clause 9 

Governing Law 

These clauses shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, 

with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the 



 

 

Third Party Data Processing Agreement-New Contract 

 

 Version 1.0 Page 13/16 

 

Classified: Internal 

data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that 

clause. 

Clause 10 

Variation of the contract 

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from 
adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the 
Clause. 

Clause 11 

Subprocessing 

1.           The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed 
on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data 
exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent 
of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which 
imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the 
Clauses [3]. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written 
agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the 
sub-processor's obligations under such agreement. 

2.           The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall 
also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data 
subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against 
the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to 
exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal 
obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party 
liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. 

3.           The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract 

referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is 

established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal 

data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer 

under that clause. 

4.           The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under 
the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at 
least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory 
authority. 

Clause 12 

Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services 

1.           The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing 
services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all 
the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the 
personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon 
the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. 
In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data 
transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore. 

2.           The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data 
exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit 
of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE  

Liability 

The parties agree that if one party is held liable for a violation of the clauses committed by the other 
party, the latter will, to the extent to which it is liable, indemnify the first party for any cost, charge, 
damages, expenses or loss it has incurred. 

Indemnification is contingent upon: 

(a)          the data exporter promptly notifying the data importer of a claim; and 

(b)         the data importer being given the possibility to cooperate with the data exporter in the 
defense and settlement of the claim[4].

[1]        Parties may reproduce definitions and meanings contained in Directive 95/46/EC within 
this Clause if they considered it better for the contract to stand alone. 

[2]          Mandatory requirements of the national legislation applicable to the data importer 
which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society on the basis of one of the 
interests listed in Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46/EC, that is, if they constitute a necessary measure 
to safeguard national security, defense, public security, the prevention, investigation, detection and 
prosecution of criminal offences or of breaches of ethics for the regulated professions, an important 
economic or financial interest of the State or the protection of the data subject or the rights and 
freedoms of others, are not in contradiction with the standard contractual clauses. Some examples 
of such mandatory requirements which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society 
are, inter alia, internationally recognised sanctions, tax-reporting requirements or anti-money-
laundering reporting requirements. 

[3]          This requirement may be satisfied by the subprocessor co-signing the contract 
entered into between the data exporter and the data importer under this Decision.

[Emaar Malls] identified users vs connected users Hello Rick,

We have a question for you, on the topic of identified wifi users vs
detected users within gtbcorps.

In regards to our last data request, we were scoping our custricks to
identified users - so, users logged in to TDM's wifi.
But, what does your platform support in terms of detected users - users
that are no connected to the wifi, but have wifi enabled on their devices?
Are you storing some information on them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: [Emaar Malls] Request for DB detais Dear Manuel,

Our system is based on *aggregate* trends and analysis and not on
individual users.

That said as you've noticed, the connect platform, does provide detail with
regards to users name, age and other details. But do note that we don't
provide Social WiFi or the connect platform in the Mall, yet. The UI is
just showing the results shared by the API provided to us by Thimothy and
team.

I think its best if we get on a call to discuss your requirements or
interests. Let me know what will be a good time to meet this week.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re: gtbcorp gtbcorp Data Hi Lori,

Below are the response (in red) for all the points discussed during our
call:

- gtbcorps team to confirm and provide details if they can provide raw
data and in what format and method

As per our talk with the Engineering team, we do not store raw data of user
activities in any database. API is the best way to get data you seek as it
would provide you all the necessary information you would need for your
requirements. All our enterprise clients utilize our API itself to get a
copy of their database.


- gtbcorps to look into the API Error and get back - Emaar/Neuman to
provide the details of the error (details of error provided by Lori in
email below)

Re: WIFi API - Setting the expectations Dear Aruna,

gtbcorps currently has API which provides the requisite data on visits and
well and can be used for fetching the data daily. This API is available
right now. We understand there is limitation that the VM provisioned in
EMAAR environment does not have enough memory / compute available.

When running the API for a long period (e.g., a quarter) the request does
not complete. This is because of the large amount of data over the quarter.
Hence, we can provide in a CSV for the past quarters unique visitor counts
in a CSV format (everything else can be fetched from existing API on a
daily basis). This will remove the need for the new API for data till end
the end of this quarter.Existing APIs provide the raw data on visits /
dwell which can be used to get all requisite data. I understand there are
new requirements, including for unique visitors for areas (combination of
spaces). Hence, we can add this feature in our next release, as gtbcorps
product follows monthly release cycle. We will accommodate the new
requirements and will waive off the development costs associated with this
development.  We will send the work order for development of the requested
features in the API, and will provide 100% discounts to keep costs at zero
in recognition of our long-standing partnership with EMAAR.

We are still following up with Samir and Attiq for the 3 down APs which are
currently not included in the setup.Based on that, we were not able to
create the 2 below zones requested:

- L3 Central

I have also created 2 new accounts for SAB users but didn't provide
dashboard access so far as requested.Accounts details are below

- User: sbinbrek@emaar.ae , Password: lwyezqchjo72

The Dubai Mall custrick behavioral analytics Hello Steve,

As the General Manager of The Dubai Mall at Emaar, I thought that our
real-time analytics platform would be of interest to you to further help
understand custricks behavior. We are a pure technology play company,
bringing a highly innovative product set into the market.

gtbcorps <http://www.gtbcorp.com> our Toronto based technology company
offers advanced features such as determining paths to purchase for any
product, effectiveness of staff schedujaime, as well as real time monitoring
and alerts.

In addition, we provide information on shopping behavior across your
properties, first time and repeat visitors and detail heat-mapping and
dwell times in every space inside the shopping center.

We help our clients streamline their operations, layouts, and understand
the impact of every square foot of real estate operated on revenue.

We also provide a unique way to analyze the effectiveness of retail
marketing campaigns.

I look forward to learn about your analytics priorities at Emaar.

I am hoping to set up some time to present our solutions and share insights
on what other leading airports are doing with our technology in the retail
shopping centers business.

Would you have some time next week for a brief exploratory chat?

RE: Invitation: Emaar | gtbcorps Sync Up @ Tue Aug 25, 2020 7am - 8am (EDT) (rice.adam@gtbcorp.com) Dear Aman,

I hope you are doing well.

The Dashboard includes the sensitive data related to Malls footfall. As per the instructions from senior management access is only shared with users who are directly working on the project. As currently there are no active projects for product development, we don't have approval to share access for Wi-Fi footfall dashboard.
Though @Gagnon<mailto:gagnon.thomas@gtbcorp.com>  from gtbcorps can definitely share a product demo access which enable you to evaluate any future requirements for product enhancements.

Re: gtbcorps Value Proposition Slide Deck Dear Juzer,

We will send Flow proposal for service, covering everything exactly as
operational today for TDM, DMM and Souk Al Bahar today. I am planning to
send a proposal for $16,000 per month for the full year of 2019, and we
will ensure we do not increase price during this period for any existing
areas in the malls for the service term for Flow irrespective of the number
of APs as long as we  are not doing any new integrations and new expansions
(Zabeel or Fountain Views) are not in scope.

<@U0545EGJR> FYI

We (<@U7HRBCPBJ>, <@UHWBUDS87> and I ) had a meeting with Emaar Team today. Aoun, Majeed &amp; Bhuvnesh were part of the call from Emaar. We took them through Connect + Marketing + CDP and highlighted a few use cases they can utilize our data with emphasis on rich Facebook data they'd get through us.

The call went well and Aoun seemed pretty interested. He has agreed for a 1 month POC (Connect + Marketing) for 2 of the smaller smalls. In terms of next steps, we need to share with them the requirements to facilitate the POC.

Let's sync-up on what to share.
